When in Bangalore we visited to get the fillings examined by a ******** doctor. There was some filling material left on the spot which she recommended to redo and we promptly agreed.Having a dental history myself,I asked a few questions and I found the answers fairly superficial .I got the feeling I made a mistake of booking her since she showed as Practo prime and popped up first on the app screen but too late in the game .There was a broad advise of the kid not biting anything 'hard ' like a pencil . Candies,pencil ( of course) and anything slightly hard things were off menu.Within 2 weeks one of the fillings completely fell off and we could not contact the doctor for about 10 days due to some issues . The kid was on a regular vegan diet of mostly rice,daal all these days .When we visited again ,she blamed the kid for doing things wrong like biting something hard. The doctor said,she had advised placing a cap on that area when she clearly said on the previous visit, a cap was not needed at that time !! She said I tell this to all -which means of course I needed better comprehension skills. She did the filling again -pretty rude and harsh with the kid and finished the procedure in a hurry.***** *** **** rudeness -too much to handle.She of-course promptly asked for her fees- pretty high - after that.Paid the fees and left with a deep feeling of regret at my choice of coming here .I am of-course going to consult another doctor to look at the kids teeth ** ***** ****** ********** *** **** ** ******* ***************** * ** **** *** *** **** * **** ************* ** ****** * ********** ****** *** ***** **** ******* ****** ** *** * ***** *** ** *** ****** *Dr. Punyatoya Sahoo repliedThanks for your horrible feedback, first of all I liked to tell you clearly that if any Patients came to me i always give proper advice and knowledge about dental because people's have less knowledge about DENTAL and related problems if they want to go for treatment or not . 2nd things ---- Composite is one of hard materials, you already met some many doctors so please go to them and ask above sentences. Without biting hard it will not come out and while having rice,dal no material specially hard materials cant come out . Add one more things if its deep and material cant hold I always advice to go for cap if I will agree I didn't tell on first time which I never ever missed out. When I mentioned on 2nd time then why didn't you go for cap treatment. Blaming a doctor so easy she didn't do prepare treatment after advice to go for treatment why didn't go for treatment. Rude to child is not going to work . You knows why they will not corporate to us. Anyway you never know you will not know because you didn't read or study about child psychology. Hold a second psychology means also you will think about his mental health no I'm talking about they are ability. Please study and get knowledge before blaming doctor about their skill.

The crowns that were fixed on that didn't last for more than 3-4 days. We again went there and fixed it twice or thrice. She only blamed the kid saying that she is always trying pull it out thats why it is coming out. As the crowns were coming out several times *** **** ****** ** *** **** ** ******* *** ***** ************ i also contacted different dentists to check the issue and understood that the issue is, the crown doesn't have a proper base to stick to the tooth as she made it very small. This was the scariest thing as the crown was coming out when the kid was having food. No medical emergency happened as my daughter was very careful while eating. Later i checked with other dentists and decided that i will not fix those crowns and made sure that the filling is proper. It was just that i lost 10000 rs only for crowns. After 2 months, my daughter started to get swelling on one of the tooth which had undergone half root canal treatment. As i have moved abroad, i showed it to one of the dentist here and they have referred me to a dental surgeon as it looks like there is some damage in the underlying nerves due to the earlier treatment and it is creating issues. After spending 25000-30000 rs on my daughter's teeth already in Bangalore, my kid have to again undergo so many more treatments and pains again. This is something that is not acceptable at all.

Thank you for your feedback and to raise your concern. I have treated your son in July 2019, when he came with history of pain at night time and he had a swelling in the gum in relation to his upper front tooth. The needful treatment plan and cost was explained to you and the treatment was begun. The root canal of your child was completed only after symptoms of pain and swelling had resolved. You are aware of the treatment as in January 2019 your daughter too underwent the same treatment from me. In the same appointment I had explained how to care for the tooth and be vigilant, and if the filling comes out it has to be refilled. In September 2019 you came to me that the filling had come out and the needful was done and only consultation was charged. At this point of time too I had told you to be vigilant and check for the filling while brushing his teeth. Some times in young children the front tooth filling may come out and the cause could be any trauma (hurt, not necessarily a fall), biting hard foods, having very sticky chocolates and foods, grinding of teeth, etc. So when you visited me in Jan 2020, the child had a swelling in the gum, and you were relieved to show the child to me. You did not have a prior appointment, but as always I allow walk in patients and you did not have any much waiting time. The tooth was examined and I asked about history of any fall or hurt, the filling was not present and you mentioned he had this pain since one day. X ray was taken and due to infection and open canal the root canal filling paste was resorbed/ had come out. (it does happen in case of infection). Child was all comfortable and cleaning and irrigation of the canal was done and the abscess was drained and area well irrigated and canal received a cotton dressing. Required medication were prescribed and you were asked to come after 3 days for follow-up and I shall attend to your child first, and you could just walk in. Consultation charge was taken and a nominal fee for abscess drainage and Xray combined. Treatment rendered to your child was of best of our ability and followed the standard protocol. You are welcome to get your child for the completion of his treatment. Wishing the best always and ready to help.', 'Visited For Broken TeethI recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionDoctor did proper analysis and explained as on various options like root canal or tooth removal for my 6 year old son who had broken and decayed teeth and gums were growing on top of that teeth.
