It has been increased or mostly relieved from time to time. There were only small patches on scalp and around ankles‚Ä¶etcRecently in June 2016, psoriasis has attacked on my face violently for first time. It was much aggressive than before very itchy and unpleasent. And it happened after a big stress in my life. Fortunately I met Ayurveda Physician Dr. Chaya at Serenity Wellness Institute, JP Nagar, Bangalore. I went for a consultation and I understood that all the steroid based treatments that i was doing before are just suppresing my symptoms and more they will suppress more it will accumulate in the body and more strongly it will come back, and she explained me that this problem can be very effectivly treated in Ayurveda with detox therapy, which is called ‚Äúpanchakarma‚Äù. In panchakarma treatment there is no suppression but it is taking the toxins out of the body to which my immunity was reacting.Once the toxins are out, our immunity does not react and no symptoms are produced on the skin, So i begun immediately ‚Äúpanchakarma‚Äù (detox) treatment at ‚ÄúSerenity Wellness Institude‚Äù in Bangalore.There are five different procedures in Panchakarma but for me only Vamana (one of its kind in panchakarma treatment) was recommened.My doctor choose to do Vamana for me a Panchakarma procedure, I felt as different person right after the treatment. Which was for total of 9 days plus 7 days of diet restrictions as an after care, Almost all the patches and wounds dissapeared. It made my mind very calm as well through the body. After that I started taking care of myself with the diet, lifestyle and some medicines as prescribed by the doctor and I am feeling much better than before. I find my self fortunate to find this amazing treatment for my disease, If I would not have done this, I would have fallen in the trap of steroid creams and other harmful chemical medicines, which would have ruined my health.On contrary Ayurvedic treatment not only cured the disease, but also made my overall health and energy levels much better.From my experience and from other patients experience those who were taking treatment for psoriasis during the same time in this clinic, I would humbly recommend Panchakarma for all the patients those who are suffering from psoriasis, as I have understood that Suppression is not the treatment for this, Panchakarma detox is a much better approach. And we can save our health from all these harmfull steroidal, chemical treatments, which harm us more than the disease itself.ALL THE BEST SERENITY.Best regards,JAY KUMAR', ""Visited For Psychological ProblemsI recommend the doctorHappy with: Wait timeI had 2 sessions with Dr Chaya.

It pushes the person further away who is anyway having problems with talking about emotions."", 'Visited For Death and bereavement issuesI recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionValue for moneyHi, I‚Äôm Divya Anand born and brought up in Bangalore, What I‚Äôm about to say is not for the sake of review alone but it is a message to the thousands of people who have a suicidal ideation every day. On an average, there are 123 suicides per day. An astounding figure that reflects the issue of mental health and its ill effects if not taken care.Yes, I was also suicidal. I felt like I was floating in a sea of emotions that were drowning me and pulling me into the abyss from which the only escape was to commit suicide. I quit my job, I was disturbed due to a failed relationship.Suicide seemed to be the only answer to all the guilt,embarrassment, disappointments, failures and negative experiences that have broken my heart to pieces, these pieces refused to be broken and feel broken for another day and suicide seemed like the answer that could give me freedom from the prison that I had built within my mind and I dreamed about this freedom every day.Negative experiences for a High Functioning Depressed person such as myself is more influential in our mind then positive experiences in our life.Some part of me still wanted to live after a failed attempt.I urge all those who have a suicidal ideation to first hold onto this part of their mind. Somewhere deep within us there is a small part that will still want to live, still want to love again, still want to experience life to its fullest irrespective of the circumstances.After which I urge you to take a positive simple step of reaching out for help by just googling a qualified counsellor in your locality.In my case I got onto practo.com and I choose Dr. Chaya Jambigi at Serenity Wellness Institute, situated at JP Nagar, Bangalore on 7th April 2018.It has been a lifesaving and life changing decision.Just talking to her and expressing all my negative experiences, gave a relief.Then I also met another counsellor Snehal who has been my therapist and is helping me in handling the negative emotions in my mind. Today slowly but steadily I‚Äôm able to dispel the sea of emotions and soar up into the sky with ease.I thank Dr. Chaya Jambigi and Snehal for their continued support and understanding towards my condition. They have played a major role in helping me survive an illness.Today, I‚Äôm not entertaining any suicidal thoughts in my mind.I have gone out to meet new people. I‚Äôm looking forward to starting my social entrepreneurial firm. I‚Äôm also looking forward to a Yoga instructor course in the coming month.An illness that is silently killing thousands every day. It can be due to impulse or due to planned decision.I recommend their services to all who need help.The first step in solving any problem is to accept that it exists in the first place.We have all been too silent about suicide.We feel bad to talk about it. We feel that we are weak to admit that we have thought about a cowardly act.We have judged ourselves for so long. Our pride is more important to us.If all can be humble for one moment to accept the flaws that we as human beings have then accepting the fact that all of us at some point of time in our life have had suicidal ideations and that some have acted towards such an ideation and some are going to do so is a given fact.Let us spread awareness about this flaw and prevent it.Let us encourage the help that psychologists, psychiatrists and counsellors provide and urge the people who need it to reach out to these individuals who provide a helping hand during desperate times.Suicide is never the answer. There is more to life, by saying NO to Suicide.We say YES to our parents who have invested millions in us in the form of love and money.We say YES to people who will love and accepts us as we are in future.We say YES to positive experiences in life.We say YES to the simple pleasures in our life.We say YES to our dreams.We say YES to another day.We say YES to the small steps we can take every day, like making a planned routine, by exercising, listening to music, watching movies, yoga, meditation all these to becomea healthy functioning individual.We say YES to handling situations and experiences in a healthier perspective. If your heart is broken by a lost love, remember there are many people who are still searching for love and you can still go on dates and find another person a better person.If we take things lightly, we see that there are so many opportunities still open to us all we need to do is be alive to take it.People are climbing mountains and running marathons when there are aged 90 years, anything is possible.So, I urge you to say YES to LIFE because you are priceless and life is still bearable with more positive experiences waiting for you, Music and Books always by your side along with professional Help just a click away.Seek that light and the light within you will slowly shine.God, bless you all for reading this, please share this with all you know. Somewhere, someone really needs this message.Take care.RegardsDivyanand', 'Visited For Shoulder PainI recommend the doctor""The best ayurvedic place!‚ÄùThis was my first visit to Serenity Wellness but for sure not my last.

Which I later (9th day) learned to be taking simple medicines at home, followed by 4 massages and a loose motion on last day.This could be good by itself, but didn\'t help my weakness issue & cough.Before going there, I saw several good reviews, but didn\'t see anything about the pricing of the ""PanchKarma"", so I will like to point it out for patient\'s and clinic\'s help.## Consultation charge is 250/-## PanchKarma constitutes-- 24 Hajmola like digestive pills for 4 days (2-2-2 per day); no clinic visit-- 150 ml bitter Ayurvedic ghee for 4 days (15ml-30ml-45ml-60ml); no clinic visit-- 1 hour body massage; which is followed by 15 mins add-on (Shirodhara, Or herbal wash, Or head massage) for 4 days; need to spend 90 mins at clinic (includes hot water bath)==>They charged me 10k/- for all the above.On the last day I inquired on individual massage, to which the reception lady told 1000/-, which includes free consultation and 15% discount on medicine !!24 hajmola and 150 ml ghee won\'t cost more than 200/- and the massages + add-ons will be 1250 x 4 = 5000/-.I ended up paying double for the same treatment which were available individually. Usually it should be other way around. If you take something in bulk, then that should be discounted. I felt naive for myself not to inquire all these in beginning.Dr. Krishna Kumar repliedHI Milind, Thanks for your valuable feedback. U were suffering from High cholesterol levels and low immunity since 3 years and u had tried almost all treatments for the same when we advised for medications, u didnt want any medicines / supplements but u wanted to do Detox Programme. ## There were no availability of slots but u insisted us to accommodate and we somehow managed to give you appointments. Our doctor planned only 12 days of treatment for ur multiple issues. We cant split the cost as you have done. For your reference  last 4 days of treatment Abhyanga + Shirodhara + UDwartahan + Steam for 1.5 duration per treatment ( BAsed on the complaints these will change ) per session is Rs.2000, along with complete support frm doctors for all days ( priceless)  We never force any customer to undergo the therapy at our place as the slots are full.

I had sought allopathic treatment for the same in the past. It did help, but only temporarily and finally lead to tolerance of the antibiotics prescribed and more acne. I was very distressed due to the continuous acne breakouts. I had tried almost everything starting from home remedies to homeopathy, but nothing really helped. In June this year i finally decided to seek ayurvedic treatment for this and met Dr. Krishna Kumar. He put me on some blood purifiers and suggested simple life style changes and dietary modifications. After about a month of starting my treatment he also suggested me to undergo charmaraksha chikitsa which is basically panchakarma treatment for skin. The combibation of blood purifiers and panchakarma reduced my acne breakout to quite an extent but some eruptions continued, however, those were not painful and puss-filled like before. After panchakarma he then put me on an ayurvedic medicine to regulate my hormonal levels and that did the biggest magic and my acne breakout came down very very significantly. After 6 months of consistent treatment my skin texture has become quite smooth and blackheads on face have also reduced. I hardly have any acne on my face now. I just have some scars left which are also disappearing gradually.I am very grateful to Dr. Kumar for helping me overcome a problem that i had been fighting with for 3 long years in just 6 months. I had actually lost hope, but he helped me regain it. The best thing about Dr. Kumar is the way he listens so patiently. He just focusses on one thing at a time. The step by step and structured approach he follows is appreciable. God bless him.Regards,PriyaDr. Krishna Kumar repliedDear Ms. Priya Puri, Thanks for your valuable feedback.

He has been a time and life saver for me atleast in this new city where I just arrived.Let me start from the beginning what problems I had and what events took me to Dr. Vinay sir.I'm from Himachal and I got job opportunity to join on IT Company here in Bengaluru.Back in home while doing WFH for long time , my back got stiffed, severe pain in my back and right leg , I developed Sciatica, also my posture was also bend on the right side . I took some Physio sessions there at my native place for 1.5 months and once I was straight enough and relieved from pain I decided to come to Bengaluru. While coming back in Airport I sat on one of those massage chair to have one session there , right after that I realized that the comfort I had earlier with my body is no more there and by the time I was having same problem again as I had earlier.I observed it for couple of days and it was getting worse as earlier. Then I start looking for the treatment for the same. While searching this time I decided to go for a Panchkarma treatment as I was already aware that along with external treatment or physio sessions , I need to improve my overall body strength too. I thought of giving it a try here otherwise fly back to my hometown with no other choice left.I found Dr. Vinay S. Singarajapura number on Google. I gave him a call on Thursday around 4.00 PM saying that I'll be coming to your Centre by evening today afte my office hours . And that day I didn't able to make it . But when on weekend I took a taxi and reached there on his Centre location and then gave a call without any appointment scheduled, he picked up the call and asked if I have an appointment, I told him that I just came now via taxi (from 23 kms far away) , and without saying more he told me to wait for some time, while he come back to attend me.Once he is in clinic he starts his observation and the after observing my pulse (naadi) he told me so many things which I was already aware about my current health condition and he advised me a well defined treatment plan.He prescribed me some Ayurvedic medicine, and started Panchkarma and manipulation therapy on Wednesday onwards. After completing those session , now my spine problems are not bothering me much and I'm still continuing the follow up sessions to recover it to the original state.Later I come to know that when I came here for his clinic on weekend that time he was about to leave Bengaluru for couple of days , but since I told him that I came in a taxi , so he might have thought that this guy is coming from long distance and so he still took some time for me from is busy schedule.After Dr Vinay's continued support and advice now I've relief and some peace of mind that I can restore back to my original physical and mental health.One more thing about his Panchkarma Treatment Centre is a well maintained, hygienic place , where someone can feel they are going to get well soon.Thank you Dr. Vinay S.

Because of this shock i could\'nt sleep for 15 days and also the palpitations used to occur frequently. Thanks to Practo.com from where i could get the contact of Dr.B.Ramesh.I have been under the care of this doctor from past 3 months and i have almost recovered from my health problems. This doctor has huge experience and he has got the knack of diagnosing patients just with Stethoscope.

He also encouraged us to enlighten ourselves by reading the pros and cons of one of the surgery option available to us (Alcohol Septal Ablation). There was an other surgery option as well but that was a major open heart surgery. So we stick to Alcohol Septal Ablation as the doctor suggested my father will benefit from it.

Although I got a temporary restoration for it, my smile has never been the same. Not only did this affect my smile but also my speech. I was recommended to Dr. Rajat Sachdeva‚Äôs clinic by a friend of mine. After a long hiatus between my dental visits, I was apprehensive and very nervous but I can say that I had the best experience at Dr. Rajat‚Äôs clinic as he made me most comfortable and relaxed. He suggested me to go for an implant for my missing tooth, and based on my CBCT scans, it was the best option for me. So, I decided to choose a single dental implant. Since it was the front tooth and had significant effect on my smile, the dentist was extremely careful and meticulously planned the entire treatment. I was even shown the end-result and it looked very promising. I was called in early on the day of surgery, and the entire procedure did not even take an hour. It was completely painless and minimally invasive. I was able to see the procedure as it was being done on the screen, and it was later given to me as my dental record. The attention to details and executing the treatment to perfection would definitely be the stand-outs of this clinic. The practice is very professional and compassionate at the same time. Throughout the process, everything was described in detail as to the road ahead, the timescale of all future visits, the costs which were spread over the whole dental treatment and the follow up visits and regular checking on all dental issues. After the procedure, I was given a temporary restoration so that I wouldn‚Äôt be toothless. My final crown came a few weeks later and it fitted like a glove. The shape, size and color of the crown was just like my other tooth, and it perfectly blended in. My speech was also clearer, the lisp was gone and I finally had a clear diction. This was truly the best possible outcome that I expected to achieve with my implant. Dr. Rajat‚Äôs clinic is truly a perfect place for getting your dental problems treated. They run an excellent, highly organized and exceptionally clean practice with top-notch facilities and technology.

Dr. Rajat‚Äôs dental clinic in Ashok Vihar can be truly called a representation of painless dentistry.Owing to years of neglect and malfunction, I had ended up with a rather unpleasant smile. I had a few missing teeth and several of them were completely worn out. When I consulted Dr. Rajat with my issues, he was very supportive and motivated me to go for a full mouth smile makeover. Before we moved forward with my case, a CBCT scan was advised which revealed in-and-out of my teeth and jaws. Based on the interpretations of these scans, Dr. Rajat formulated the treatment plan; which consisted of many procedures which included rehabilitation of missing teeth, crowns and veneers for worn-out teeth and to fill the gaps between my upper front teeth. Most of teeth were decayed and had to be restored as well.As the treatment started, I was made quite comfortable and even the complex of the procedures like placement of implants were done effortlessly. In all my appointments, the chair time did not exceed for more than an hour and that just shows the expertise of your treating dentist. Emax and Zirconia crowns were fabricated using CAD CAM software and the value they added to my aesthetics was substantial.Several of my teeth were decayed, few of which needed root canal treatments. Lasers was used to eliminate the infection completely and quickly too. It was definitely reassuring to be able to watch the procedure done on your teeth, and Dr. Rajat made it possible by use of dental microscopes. I could actually see what exactly went in and came out of those tiny canals. The evolution of dentistry never ceased to amaze me.For the final touch, I underwent a teeth whitening procedure using Philips Zoom! equipment. It is a rather magical technique, for the results were eminent immediately. Overall, I can say that Dr. Rajat has worked wonders with my smile and I can only than him and his team for my newfound confidence. Not only that, my function has also improved considerably and I can now bite into my favorite foods without any fear of sensitivity or pain.

As a result, my teeth had completely lost its luster and became dull. I had tried a number of at home remedies for teeth whitening like lemon and vinegar but nothing worked much. When I finally decided to take a professional help, I started to search a good dentist near me.Dr. Sachdeva's Dental clinic had many positive reviews on Google and had carried out multiple successful whitening procedures. So I consulted him and he advised me zoom whitening. The most important thing that he warned me was that the procedure would be a success if only I followed post-operative instructions like no smoking for at least a month and no chromogemic beverages like tea or coffee for a week. It was good to understand the technique and its outcome before I finalize it.The procedure was rather simple and completely pain free. Once they apply the bleaching gel, it is activated using LED light-accelerated technology which almost instantly whitens your teeth. The process was repeated four times until I got the desired shade. The results are seen almost immediately and improves over the due course. I got about 5 shades brighter teeth on the very same day. I couldn't believe it until I saw it myself. Dr. Rajat has done fantastic work with my teeth and I am really grateful for that. I was even provided with GC tooth mousse paste which helped rebuild the tooth structure lost to decay and would lessen the sensitivity. The entire experience at Dr. Rajat‚Äôs clinic was very positive and encouraging.

He is a renowned cosmetic dentist in Ashok Vihar, Delhi. He informed me that these yellowish stains on the teeth are normal and may result due to multiple factors like from age, food and beverages. When he suggested Philips Zoom whitening procedure, I readily agreed because it has a good reputation and it is one of the best tooth whitening kits in the market.I had to get a scaling procedure done at first where they cleaned the plaque and tartar on my teeth. This was done so that the whitening procedure would be effective. The procedure began by covering my lips and gums and only my teeth were exposed. This was done apparently to protect them from the UV light. Zoom whitening gel was applied onto my teeth and a zoom light was shone which helped activate the gel. The gel remained on my teeth for maybe 15-20 minutes. They repeated this procedure thrice after which a desensitizing fluoride gel was applied to reduce sensitivity.The entire process of teeth whitening using Philips Zoom whitening procedure took about just an hour and the results were mind-blowing. My teeth looked significantly whiter and my smile was radiant. I would like to thank Dr. Rajat and his team for their incredible work with my teeth. I really appreciate it.

This process is repeated for around four times, depending on the shade you want or amount of discoloration. You can listen to a relaxing music while the gel does its magic.

I hope the readers benefit from my experience."", ""Visited For Acne / Pimples TreatmentI do not recommend the doctorHoped for better: Value for moneyDoctor friendlinessTreatment satisfactionThe issue is if I explain why I wasn't satisfied, the doctor will write a long explanation of why I am wrong. I've never seen a doctor write such long explanations to prove a patient wrong!But I feel if my feedback helps somebody else, it's worth reading the long reply the doctor is sure to right.I went to the doctor because of my recurrent acne and boil problem. He didn't examine the affected area but said that this issue is common. I figured that the doctor is an expert so he did not need to see what the problem is. Then he spent 2 mins writing the medicine and 2 mins telling me to minimize sweets and milk and then 10 mins telling me about chemical peels which is kind of expensive I know of other clinics which offer salicylic peels at Rs 500 per session and his price was triple the cost. . (I understand that he is a celebrated doctor so treatment may be expensive!) My previous dermatologist told me to go for peels only after the pimple subsided but this doctor said there is no such condition.Then I was asked to buy medicine from the clinic itself by the receptionist which I felt was fishy. No dermatologist has specifically asked that. I refused and went to 10 pharmacies who all said they don't have the medication. Finally a pharmacist told me that that particular doctor prescribes medicine that are expensive and rare so no pharmacy would carry it!All in all, I was not given much explanation of what's wrong, the medication is impossible to find and I was advised something that some other doctor advised against. So i have no clarity and will have to see another doctor, spend another few hours and another few thousand..I understand if the doctor didn't find my issue serious enough or had a long line of patients to see, so he could't devote time. But I will not understand if the doctor writes a long essay explaining why I am wrong and he is right. It's highly unprofessional and unheard of! I request you to let it go, you treated me and I gave feedback. Let that be the end.I'm sure you're a very good doctor so I mean no offense to you.Dr. Parthasarathi Dutta Roy repliedDear Tanya, The issue is that when you give a feed back and tell why you are not satisfied, it is completely your opinion.Then when I give my answer to that, it is my opinion, my point of view. There is no intension to prove anybody wrong. My explanations are backed with logic; I do not write whatever comes to mind. Whether you are right or me would not be judged by either you or me but by the third parties, the viewers. I am happy that you have never seen a Doctor to write such long explanations. That shows that the Doctor is different in some ways and he cares for his patients. I do not want to be one among the lot. Because of the softness and decency of the Doctors today situation has come to a point where Doctors are getting abused and beaten up in different parts of the country. Doctors are getting abused everywhere inspite of trying their best to save your life. So a message should go to the society that all Doctors are not pushovers. If you attack Doctors it should be given back with interest, and for doing that if you do not like it have no problems. If you are giving a healthy feedback with logic it would be appreciated, but if you write something without logic and just to express your grudge it would be and should be answered. After all you can not write anything and everything comes to your mind in a public platform and expect the other person not to reply. I am really thankful to Practo for providing a space where Doctors can put their point of view and tell their side of the story. When you feel that giving a feedback would help other people to understand the Doctor I also think that my long explanation and feedback would help people to understand the situation. First of all, for your kind information, hundreds of patients of mine got results with my acne treatments and you yourself must have seen that in the net and that‚Äôs why have consulted me. I equally distribute my timings between examining a patient, writing prescription and explaining procedures, so telling that I have given more time to convince you for a chemical peel is totally unfair. For the treatment of acnes I usually follow three steps, first take history and write prescription, second tell you about your diet and third I explain you if any procedure is required(in your case it was Salicylic acid peel). Why did not you mention in your feedback that Doctor has also told you that the chemical peels are not absolutely compulsory but optional, in addition to the medications to enhance the results.You have spoken about Sali peel and also mentioned that it would cost Rs 500/- in other clinics. I am very curious to know where those clinics are, whether you are talking about a Clinic in Bangalore or in any other town or village? Show me a centre in Indiranagar,Bangalore where chemical peelings are done for Rs 500/- I promise you I would give you 6 sessions of Sali peel free of cost. Secondly when you say that another Doctor asked you to do peels after acnes subside, you are not only showing your ignorance about the subject but also putting the Doctor down as well. Salicylic acid peels are done to reduce pimples, what is the use in doing it after the acnes subside? Besides, this is our clinic price which is same for everyone. If you can afford it take it, otherwise leave it, why you want to make a big fuss out of it? Did we force you to take that? I must mention here that you have got a very sensitive nose since you can sniff everything fishy very fast. If the receptionist has asked you to buy the medicines then he is just doing his job. Just imagine at the most what it could be due to? He has just thought from the business point of view, anyway you have to buy the medicines from some pharmacy,so if you buy it from our pharmacy we will get benefited, that‚Äôs it. Whats wrong in that? Anyway I have given them a strict instruction, henceforth not to ask anyoneto buy medicines, since some people tend to take it in a wrong way, whether medicines are available outside or not. You have written that you had no clarity and you have to consult another Doctor which would cost you few more thousands,my question is have you taken the medicines I have prescribed and seen the results? If not then why blame the Doctor?You have nobody but yourself to blame just for not trusting the Doctor and following his instructions and that is why thinking another Doctor. I can tell you confidently if you would have followed my instructions you would have definitely got results and would not have to visit another Doctor and spend few more hours and few more thousands.And do you think it needs few thousands to consult a Doctor? It is really unfortunate when you doubt the intension of a reputed Doctor. I had prescribed you a course of antibiotic, a combination cream for your acnes, a non comedogenic moisturizer and an anti-acne face wash. That is what I prescribe my other patients as well with your kind of acnes [Grade-3]. Tell me what extra medicines I have given you and are these medicines very expensive? To prove yourself right you should not be a liar. I never tell my patients to buy medicines from my centre unless asked. If only they ask me where to get these medicines I may tell them that these are available in the clinic pharmacy itself.Is it wrong to keep some result oriented medicines which has given results to so many of my patients and what can the Doctor do if these are not available in other pharmacies? On the contrary patients are happy that they are getting to buy the medicines in the same place unless people like you who finds everything fishy in every small thing.When you say that one pharmacist told you that this Doctors medicines are costly and rare and we do not keep, do you think that the Pharmacist is seating there to do social work for the society? To answer your sarcastic comment I would again say that yes I am an expert in my field and for that I have spent 10 long years of my life in training. Besides I don‚Äôt see anything great in that. When you work in a particular field for a very long time automatically you become expert in that. Softwear people becomes expert in their field,teachers become expert in their field,actors become expert in their field and so on. When you accuse the Doctor that he did not explain things properly I must mention here that In the beginning itself I tell all my acne patients that pimples are due to hormonal fluctuations and there is no complete cure for pimples, only we can keep it under control with medication, what more explanations you expect! To conclude, I must inform you that this long assay is not for your understandings. I am least bothered about that. If someone decides not to understand things come what may, nobody can help him. This explanation is rather for the public,the viewers and for my regular patients,if they are satisfied with my explanations I am happy. I do not need to learn professionalism from you nor do I need your certificate. I have got enough certificate in my credit from all over the world. All I can say is Doctors devotes time according to the merit of the cases, do not be so impatient and suspicious in nature and do not judge a Doctor only on the basis of a 15 minutes consultation and without seeing the results of his treatment."", 'Visited For Skin Disease TreatmentI recommend the doctorHappy with: Treatment satisfactionDoctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueA Dr. With Extreme wisdom!

I was suffering from acute hair loss Hair DiseaseHair Mesotherapy PRP for hair loss. And was suffering for the past 2 years, consulted doctors and wasted my money on them but now i am so happie with the result after visiting and consulting dr. Juvitha. Extremely satisfied & happy Short background: -I started doing research for finding out the best clinic in Bangalore for Dermatologist and trichologist in August 2021. In a course of over 2 years, after spending around 15k just in consultations with around 10 top clinics, I zeroed down on two of them & finally selected Dr. Juvitha. If you think about a good clinic in Bangalore, chances are that I have probably visited that. :) My reasons to go for procedure with Dr. Juvitha : - (i) 17 years of experience - Dermatologist, Cosmetologist and trichologist started gaining traction in last decade in India, so technically she is in this domain since the beginning with renowned Dermatologist and Cosmetologist in Indiranagar, Bangalore. She is the Medical Director of Dr. Juvita's Aesthetics, Skin, Hair and Cosmetology Clinic, in Indiranagar, Bangalore. Her clinic is the best rated dermatology center in Bangalore. She is a lady Dermatologist in Bangalore and has an experience of 17 years. Dr. Juvita as been chosen as one of the ' TOP 10 Cosmetologist in india YEAR 2021', by Women Entrepreneur India (ii) She is a Cosmetologist apart from being a Dermatologist Dermatologist, Cosmetologist and trichologist. Trichologist is a lot about aesthetics. No matter how good a treatment is done if the final appearance is not good it amounts to nothing. So, a touch of artistry by someone trained in it would most of the time be better than the one not trained. (iii) Very accommodative - I asked over 100 questions during consultations (Many of which I knew the answers about from my visits to other clinics but just to be sure one final time, lol!!). She answered all of them. Changed my timings for consultation & few other tantrums, all accommodated. (iv) Results- I saw results of patients who had undergone treatments and services & interacted with them about their experience. Now what sealed the deal for me: -(iv) Integrity - While at many clinics I was suggested to go for higher number of grafts which she could have done as well & made some quick and easy bucks. But she suggested me to preserve my grafts & go for what is required (A great suggestion in retrospect!).When I insisted to go for more graft for more density , she also assured me that she would do a second followup again without extra charge if I was not satisfied!!! (top notch professional medical ethics, hard to find these days!!) Treatment Experience(i) Administrative officer there - very helpful & friendly, took care of all the things after and been with an good follow up for next sessions (ii), Doctors were very punctual, and did not wait a long time for consultation. I was not. üôÇ Final word :- I have taken time out to write this review only because I am very happy with my results & this is least I could do for doctors who are skillful & have not yet yielded to the commodification of healthcare in a world where it appears that entire ecosystem is designed to rip you off !!

I chose Dr.Shashidhar T from Dermacare Skin & Hair Clinic, Jayanagar, after a lot of research and my hard work worked for me. Today, I am blessed with an amazing hair growth at my bald area. All of the credit goes to Dr.Shashidhar.I had been facing hair loss issue since 4 -5 years. Initially I thought that it‚Äôs a normal but unfortunately there was no stop on my hair loss. Gradually, the baldness increases and there was a big bald area that everyone could notice.Finally, I thought of going for hair transplant. I was aware of the procedure but my knowledge about the procedure was very limited. I researched a lot to learn more about the hair transplant and soon I found out about Dr.Shashidhar T from Dermacare Skin & Hair Clinic. I would say he is genuinely transparent and would never rush you to take the decision. Hair transplant is not a small decision as we have to spend a good amount of money.Finally, I believed the benefits of hair transplant and chose to go for it Dr.Shashidhar is very popular and an excellent surgeon for hair transplant in Bangalore.When I consulted him, he informed me about the grade of my baldness and required hair roots for hair transplant. He also explained me about the details and procedure of hair transplant and cleared all the queries I had regarding the procedure. I was impressed by the transparency they maintain as they did not sugar coat the things and gave genuine suggestions.Finally, I picked up a date and underwent hair transplant. The procedure went as expected. The whole team of Dr.Shashidhar is very experienced and it reflects in their work. I am not well versed with the instruments they used but the technology they use was latest. They maintain utmost hygienic practises while performing hair transplant.After hair transplant, the healing was easy going, because they will provide all the necessary information about DOs and DON‚ÄôTs post-surgery. Now it has been 1 year of my hair transplant and I can see an amazing hair growth. The hair growth looks absolutely natural. Except for the people already know about my hair loss, no one could identify that I have gone under hair transplant. Surprisingly, my hair stylist also couldn‚Äôt realize that I have undergone hair transplant.I am overwhelmed to see such incredible results.

Shivashankar to anybody after what he has done to my skin.I was taking treatment from him for over 4 months for skin pigmentation. When none of his medicines worked over the months, he suggested that I should go for a Laser surgery. Since I am out-stationed, I took one sitting of the Laser which was done by a person who was a professional in doing the same (and not the doctor). The skin pigmentation all over the face was burnt by laser, however after a week, the wound healed and the result was good. I went for a second setting, as the Doc said 3 setting minimum was required. This time the professional was not called and the Laser was done by the ""Receptionist"" of the clinic. Yes, the doctor was confident enough to hand over the instrument to the receptionist to burn my face. She burnt my skin deeper and spreaded it all over my face (even where there was no pigmentation) making the situation worse. It took 2.5 weeks for the wound to heal, but the marks remained deep and dark unlike the 1st setting. Meanwhile I had to go back to my native and the mark remained growing deeper and spreading all across my face.The pigmentation has become much worst and now incurable. Dark Brown patches are all over my face now and I can\'t even go out to public gatherings.If you want to recover from your issues, kindly never visit him. Also, the receptionists at his clinic makes sure that you pay 400 rupees on every visit, may it be a follow up visit or a regular visit.', 'Visited For Hair Removal TreatmentI do not recommend the doctorDoctore charged very high fees for hair removal from side lock area compared to other clinics.

Unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt able to reach the concerned doctor again even after multiple attempts and the allergy progressed to facial swelling. It was rapidly getting worse and that‚Äôs when a family friend recommended Dr.Govind to me. In retrospect, I think consulting Doctor was one of the best dermatological decisions I could ever have made. The medicines prescribed by Dr.Govind worked wonders for me.2) In the past, I have been prescribed multiple medicines for long periods of time. Unfortunately, my issues were never quite resolved with these medicines.Dr.Govind prescribed only one medicine and so far, it‚Äôs seemed to address all my dermatological issues.3) In the aftermath of a respiratory infection, I developed rashes which seemed to be present for a while. At the beginning of the consultation, even before my explanation regarding the infection commenced, Dr.Govind took one look at the rashes and immediately asked me if I had been having any respiratory issues lately. It was quite surprising to receive an immediate and accurate diagnosis by Doctor even before the explanation began just by a quick visual observation. Dr.Govind was quite astute in identifying the issue.The above incidents have taken place over the past months this year and till date, I think Dr.Govind is one of the best dermatologists in Bangalore.The support personnel at Therapeia have been extremely helpful and prompt in addressing my needs. I‚Äôve never had an issue with booking appointments or with follow-up clarifications and call-backs have always been initiated to clarify any doubts.Thank you so much Dr.Govind and Team TherapeiaDr. Govind S Mittal repliedThank you for your elaborate feedback.

Dr Govind and Team Therapeia', 'Visited For Hair TransplantI recommend the doctorMy hair transplant experienceBefore I begin this testimonial let me tell you that I was really apprehensive about going for a transplant and with the kind of stuff I was hearing from people I seriously thought even if I were to get one I would get it done abroad. I would just like summarise my experience point-wise to make it more objective.1. I was never forced to get a transplant down which was a big difference compared to many prior meetings with various doctors and clinics.2. The Transplant procedure was clearly explained to me as an option alongwith the pros and cons of getting one under 2 methods FUE and FUT I chose the former after checking as to what suited me best.3. Dr.Mittal is one of the most approachable doctors I have known and I have sometimes asked him the same questions multiple times and he has always been there to answer whether it is 10 in the morning or 10 in the night.4. The surgery in itself was a long procedure but I never felt uneasy and never felt like it was a surgery I undergoing . I was impressed with the meticulous preparation and planning that he does and although the surgery was performed at a new hospital there were no hiccups and there was no panic in the air at any point in time. I would also like to mention that the team Dr.Mittal has is fabulous and are very patient. At no point at time was i suffering from undue pain or discomfort.5. If the transplant is the cake post-op is the icing and this is where I strongly believe is what sets Dr.Mittal apart. Further The PRP sessions were great and done meticulously with utmost care and precision. I must appreciate the effort he puts in ensuring that you are actually following the post op routine. The results have been encouraging so far andOn the whole I can say if you are thinking transplant you can blindly go to Dr.Mittal.', 'Visited For Skin TreatmentI recommend the doctorHappy with: Explanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionValue for moneyDoctor friendlinessWait timeI am very happy & extremely satisfied with the treatment given by Dr. Govind Suresh Mittal, whom.

The treatment prescribed by them used to worsen my skin with lot of rashes and itching, which eventually led me to stop the treatment. The problem was so bad that many people asked as to what has happened to my skin. My family insisted on me looking out for a better dermatologist who can diagonize properly to give better treatment and I chanced upon Dr. Govind Mittal.

You are one of those people whose motto is just to speak ill against we doctors,just to gratify your inner satisfaction. Now coming to your case. You visited our clinic with impacted nasal stud,and the treatment of choice is removal under local anaesthesia. Before proceeding with the case any surgeon on this earth would give test dose using 2 percent lignocaine(0.5cc in left forearm),since this drug is highly reactive and can cause severe anaphylactic reaction.Only after confirming the drug is not reactive,we proceed to the local area for 2nd injection so as to numb the region. Therefore two pricks is inevitable for any surgery under local anaesthesia on this earth. And these thing were well explained to you in clear words in your language, devoting 10 minutes for this. You gave your consent for the procedure,and requested our nursing staff to shift you to the procedure room. The moment you heard that two pricks has to be given,you started creating scene there in front of other patients and started screaming that the current environment was hostile and started crying inspite of explaining the entire procedure before hand which was never expected from you. In your words you expect us to do any procedure as per your wish,as per your will, without giving test dose endangering the life of innocent patients,and if we do something as per the law,as per the ethics you would express your views in this way.In simple words you should have just told NO I don't want to get it done and get away but it seems you had visited our clinic just to malign our name. We doctors feel pitty on people like you,who thinks medical profession should work according to your dictat. At least you all should think of the people who are daily sacrificing their life for people like you in this pandemic and still you are having grudges against the medical fraternity that too when we are right.

Though 15 days had passed, I still thought of trying my luck and went and met the doctor. The doctor was so friendly and he explained the treatment so well that I was ok to take the steroid injections. Since it was a localized treatment, I was convinced by the doctor that the side effects will be hardly any. He answered each and every question of mine very patiently and made me so comfortable that i effortlessly went through the treament. He gave me so much of hope with the way he handled me. I went with 65% hearing loss and after 5 days of treatment, I got 68% hearing back. I could start hearing better. Doctor asked me to wait for another 1 month (without any medication) and check again. The audio metry results further went up by 75% which was a great improvement. I am convinced that this doctor can do miracles with just the way he takes care of his patients and would strongly recommend him for any ENT issue especially sudden hearing loss.

Dr.Mukta welcomed us into the room and she spoke to us just like a friend. She comforted us and asked us the routine questions; she advised us to go for a pregnancy test.

How right she was!All through our scans, multiple pregnancy check up visits , she guided us along the correct path. There were stages where there were reasons to get tensed and scared, however, she assured us and calmed us. She gave us strict advice to avoid outside food(as much as possible) and eliminate any source that can cause problem to the baby. We adhered to the 'T' and I guess that's what was the best for the baby and mommy!She encouraged mommy to be as active as possible - regular walks, Pre-Natal Yoga (Squats are great) - to target a Normal Delivery. This pushed mommy(and Daddy) for regular walks! Dr Mukta also encouraged mommy (and Daddy) to actively take Lamaze classes (which tremendously helped during Mommy's active labor) . All these are indications to Dr Mukta's sustained efforts for mommy's normal delivery!Come the 'D' day where the bundle of joy wanted to come out and Dr. Mukta was right there to help mommy with the delivery!

She is an expert in laparoscopic gynaecological surgeries and her skill and competence ensures successful minimally invasive surgery resulting in greatly reduced recovery timelines.I first start consulting Dr Shafalika at Manipal (then Columbia Asia), Yeshwanthpur in 2019. I had heavy and painful periods + gastro problems triggered by periods. The scan confirmed the presence of multiple fibroids as well as adenomyosis (thick uterine lining).Although Dr Shafalika is a surgeon, she will never advise surgery as the first course of treatment and only when absolutely necessary. Dr. told me I will eventually have to be operated but did not want to operate then. She broke the news to me with extreme kindness and compassion and put me on oral medications to try and suppress symptoms. The oral meds worked for some time but after a few months, I started getting severe migraines. I had moved to the other end of Bangalore by then and did not meet the doctor for my follow up appointment which was due in Feb 2020 due to work related travel. After that, the pandemic started and my visit was delayed greatly (due to my over-indexation on Covid).I went back to meet the doctor after getting severe period cramps and gastritis in Jan, 2022. Again, she answered all my queries with patience and grace and did not rush me towards surgery although we both knew that was inevitable. When I was mentally ready, I went back and got my surgery done by her in June 2022. She ensured I was comfortable and as I didn‚Äôt have insurance, she did her best to reduce the cost of the procedure. It was a complex surgery but Dr. Shafalika was very confident that she would be able to handle it laparoscopically (and she did)!On the day of the procedure, she arrived early and held my hand throughout the administration of general anaesthesia. She also reassured me wrt to the queries and concerns I had. During surgery, it was determined that I also had a bad case of endometriosis. At the hands of a lesser skilled surgeon, there was every possibility that my surgery would shift to an ‚Äúopen‚Äù one. But Dr. Shafalika managed to conduct the same laparoscopically.While at the hospital, I saw how well respected she was among her colleagues at Manipal (and deservedly so). She even came to meet me on a Sunday, the day after my operation!My post-surgical follow up with the doctor has been equally pleasant and efficient. In the follow up meeting, she again spent a fair amount of time with me and addressed all my queries. There is always a long queue of patients outside her office (some from out of town), but she never rushes you. It is easy for a doctor to become clinical as this is routine work for them, but Dr. Shafalika knows that while she has many patients; for the patient, she is the only doctor! \uf04aI developed a UTI infection post surgery and the doctor has been helping me address that very efficiently through telephonic consultation via her assistant, Nimisha. Nimisha is also a very kind and helpful person and enables access to Dr. Shafalika as needed. This is super helpful as I live 2.5 hours away.I have been so impressed with Dr. Shafalika‚Äôs work ethic as well as care and concern for her patients, that I have recommended her to my neighbour who is evaluating similar surgery.I no longer have to plan my life around my menstrual cycle. And am so glad I met Dr. Shafalika and got the procedure done in her able hands and care. Thank you doctor!

It has been one week since my surgery and my recovery is going well.

Started off with medication that didn‚Äôt help at all. I had severe Dysmenorrhea and would take 5-6 pain killers per menstrual cycle. I tried to get pregnant but that didn‚Äôt happen too. My symptoms grew worse. It started affecting my daily quality of life. For the next 1 year I kept running from doctor to doctor trying to get a solution to my problem and plan a way for me to get pregnant. After running from pillar to post and after 1 failed laparoscopy surgery by another doctor (owing to the fact that my case was very complicated) I had almost reached a dead end, just then through sheer luck I was referred to Dr. Shafalika SB. I was all the way in abroad back then. That first telephonic call with her changed my very life. Given the fact that I had met so many doctors by then, I had never come across a doctor like her ever before. The way she spoke to me over the call, calmed me down like a mother would and empathized and acknowledged the suffering that I was going through was enough to take half of my anxiety away. The confidence that she spoke with, clearly explained me all the details and the steps ahead; She had a clear plan of treatment for me. Whilst I was abroad, whatever doubts I had she would patiently reply to them over whatsapp (despite having such a hectic schedule). She is an incredible person besides being a highly experienced doctor!The surgery was scheduled in April. I had too many apprehensions in my mind due to a failed laparoscopy surgery that I had undergone a few months ago (in abroad). After meeting Dr. Shafalika in person, she clearly took me through the entire condition once again, clearly explained the steps of the procedure and told me the possible outcomes of the procedure. My surgery was extremely complicated one as I had a frozen pelvis (the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bowel, rectum were all plastered to the uterus, the adenomyosis had spread to the entire uterus, the uterus had reached 20 weeks size). It was going to be a challenge and highly risky to separate the organs from one another and then remove the cysts. I was well informed about everything. With a doctor with such a foresight and confidence, I took the leap of faith. Inside the OT, as soon as I saw her, my anxiety disappeared. She held my hand, smiled and said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm there with you. I‚Äôll try my best‚Äù. And with that I drifted into a sweet sleep.They say prayers have immense strength in them. 4 hours later, Dr. Shafalika came out victorious, smiling and in content with the success of the surgery. She was literally god sent! What seemed highly risky and complicated in the beginning was a success now. Dr. Shafalika was able to successfully remove the endometriotic cyst along with the adenomyosis despite the various complications. Having such experience and expertise, you can close your eyes and trust her. Here I am, writing this review because I want every woman out there like me to be able to get help. I shall forever be indebted to her.Dr. Shafalika SB is a gem of a person, highly experienced gynecologist and laparoscopic surgeon specializing in minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery and one of the best doctors that I have ever come across.

Her recommendation of a specific blood test in the early stage of pregnancy made sure we got the right medication at the right time due to the presence of a deficiency.The pregnancy itself was a bumpy ride with my wife being diagnosed with appendicitis in the 12th week. Dr.Brunda worked together with another surgeon at Cloud Nine and ensured the appendicitis surgery went fine by recommending specific doses of medicines to ensure fetus can withstand the surgery.Post this, we found that one of the uterine arteries was supplying less blood ‚Äì once again she prescribed medications to ensure we overcome these complications. Despite all complications she always encouraged by wife to keep doing her regular activities and advised us to not treat pregnancy as a handicap but as a normal phase of life. She even encouraged my wife to continue to work during pregnancy.Finally during the 33rd week, one of the scans went awry and when we met Dr. Brunda she immediately asked us to get admitted and performed Non Stress Test (NST) periodically to ensure the safety of the baby. A key thing to highlight is that during the same time, Dr.Brunda was going thru a personal emergency (her husband was hospitalized and in ICU). Despite this, she was a thorough professional and monitored the progress of our baby. Hats off to Dr. Brunda for her dedication to work despite the personal situation she was in. Finally after multiple consultations with another Radiologist who had performed the Pregnancy scans ‚Äì Dr. Brunda decided to proceed with a Caesarian and successfully delivered the baby.However, keep in mind that she is an extremely busy lady and you possibly would be only visiting her once in 3-4 weeks during the course of the pregnancy. You will need to remind her of your specific case each time. We overcame this by making notes and ensuring we go prepared to the consultation session with the questions that we needed to get clarified. Also, note that she is sometimes very open and straight forward if she identifies any issues which may sound a bit negative or discouraging to expectant mothers.

She ensured that I don‚Äôt gain weight during pregnancy, never prescribed unnecessary scans or medicines.She has never rushed me, have always answered my questions, as she is a very strong confident person, people tend to be not themselves in front of her, so end up with a feeling that she does not answer your questions, we noted our questions and only left the room when all of them were answered. NEVER once were we felt we were being rushed.She is a no nonsense doctor, laying out the facts before you, does not mince words, or try to sugar coat them, she just wants the best for the mom and the baby, and will definitely throw a fit if you gain weight beyond the limit.For me the pain was induced at night, and the baby was delivered the next morning, all through the night the duty doctors were calling and informing her of my progress, In the morning I was taken to the labour room, the duty doctors prepared everything and then she rushes in, the moment I saw her enter the labour room, I was so so relaxed, cannot explain that feeling, I knew I was safe now.She calmed me down, as the pain was severe, I did not opt for an epidural, neither did she ever recommend that, then very calmly she led me through the delivery process.All through out the pregnancy, there was never an instance where she was rude or impatient with me, she was under going severe stress at a personal level, as her husband was in the ICU, but never once did it show.I have seen her very very stressed out too, a lady was about to lose her twins, as there was a lot of bleeding, she got the lady admitted, directed the doctors on the treatment, then saw me in the consultation room, but her mind was not there, even her handwriting was not the same, we asked her to go and check up on the lady, we will wait, She went and came back a lot calmer afterwards, this showed that her empathy is not at all fake.There was another instance, where she sent a lady who was in the theatre, fully prepared to give delivery, to be told by her to go home, as it was still not the time, she always tries for a normal delivery, unless the situation warrants a c section.I am glad that I consulted Dr Brunda, and will always recommend her to anyone who is looking for a good gynaecologist.', 'Visited For PCOD/PCOS TreatmentI do not recommend the doctorHoped for better: Doctor friendlinessTreatment satisfactionWait timeDoctor had recommended Cervical Cancer vaccine to my wife.

So she immediately gave me the necessary tablets and she made sure she cross checked everything just to be on the safer side which I really appreciate... not every doctor would take that extra step. Usually we see pregnancy as a sickness but this doctor made my pregnancy like a cakewalk. She didn‚Äôt warn me about anything she said all you have to do is eat healthy and be normal like how I was before pregnancy..in my third trimester I opted for elective c-section ( it was my decision) she suggested we could go for induced labour but I obliged. She neatly explained the pros and cons of a surgery. Then in my 39th I delivered a baby girl. Doc was on time and she did the surgery with so much ease.. I wasn‚Äôt on general anaesthesia so I had an idea of what was happening around me. She kept talking to me throughout the surgery and I felt so relieved. I trusted her completely. Then came post partum she made sure she changed my supplements and she even suggested on what I should eat and she kept a tab on my iron levels by getting my blood tested. So be it pre or during or post pregnancy she was there throughout my journey with the same enthusiasm. I would definitely recommend her because she‚Äôs such a professional.She also has her own clinic. First health clinic which is close by to Cloudnine Jayanagar. Sometimes when I had to just show her my report I‚Äôd go to her clinic because it wasn‚Äôt as crowded as Cloudnine.I‚Äôd give her a 10 on 10 for her professionalism and the way she deals with situations. She‚Äôs one amazing doctor and a person.', ""Visited For Pregnancy Check UpI do not recommend the doctorHoped for better: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionWait timeThis is my first pregnancy. After lot of speculation we thought we should go to cloudnine since we didn't know any other place and we chose Dr. Brunda. Although I have read mixed reviews on practo I thought I should not judge her based on a few bad reviews. So we went ahead since cloud nine assured us that she is a very experienced doctor.So Dr. Brunda turns out to be an extremely blunt doctor with no empathy. On the first visit she made herself very clear that she would not entertain any sob story. Ok, I thought may be that's good...in a way I will be strong. So as my pregnancy proceeded I developed cramps in my stomach...like serious cramps. When I told doctor about those cramps and asked her why it might be happening...her epic reply was, '' pregnant women come with various imaginary complaints, we can't explain everything. If it was so serious today you wouldn't be able to sit in front of me''. However I was not convinced. So I decided to take another opinion. These cramps were really bothering me. So my new doctor examines me, even without me telling her she asked me if i have cramps. When I said yes, she examined me some more and said that my uterus is soft and I have chances of going into premature Labour!!!! She put me on medication immediately. I was shocked. Dr. Brunda didn't even listen to my complaint...didn't examine me...directly concluded that my problem was imaginary. Other than this particular experience there were instances where she would not listen to complaints I had regarding my health. ''Don't cry wolf. Because when the wolf would actually be here I wouldn't know''. So I actually stopped complaining and started googling for anything that bothered me.After this I am definetely never going back to her neither am I recommending anyone to go to her.A piece of advice for the doctor. Not everyone knows what to expect during pregnancy. As a doctor we look up to you. We trust you. The least a patient can expect is your empathy and a listening ear."", 'Visited For Pregnancy Check UpI recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionValue for moneyBrunda madam was firstly very friendly person or can say someone who‚Äôs very known to us who tries to make us understand whats the issue happening with our body what is the alternatives methods can be done also she suggested me what kind of treatment goes well with my conditionAlso out of the treatment she suggested me other health tips for my further healthier pregnancy.Seeing positive negative comments about her i felt little scared that she is straight forward in talk and also half minded before meeting her but then when i met her and spoke to her about my issue happening she calmly listened to me and told me wait for sometime and do scanning again.

In our second pregnancy, my blood sugar levels were borderline high but mam handled it in a very calm way and suggested to do portion control and continue the same diet instead of suggesting a completely different diet which makes it difficult to follow.

I was really anxious & upset to hear that. If she could have hinted the same before then I would have time to find another good doctor but at this late stage I really don't know when my wife could go into her labor pains.Nevertheless, after I returned from the clinic, I took up the daunting task of finding another doctor who could be much at least caring & of course an expert. After a day of search and speaking with my colleagues & friends, I decided to visit Dr. Shobha Venkat at Cloudnine hospital in ORR. Without wasting anytime, I booked an appointment with her the very next day.On the appointment day, both of us were little anxious as we were not sure if doctor would be available & more importantly would accept taking forward my wife pregnancy at such late stage. With this apprehension, we both went into the doctor's chamber.Dr. Shobha Venkat was extremely welcoming. My first impression of her was she is a nice, calm, well poised, well behaved and extremely welcoming doctor. She not only gave us confidence of her availability during the pregnancy but also calmed both us. I found her an expert and the one who knows her work very well. After I came out of the visit, both of us were extremely happy that finally we found the right doctor. There was no other doubts thereafter.As my baby was little more on weight & my wife started showing tendency of sugar inclination, Dr Shobha advised us to go ahead with the delivery a week before my wife's due date. On the planned date, doctor tried their best to help my wife to deliver naturally but things were not moving as expected. Then again Dr. Shobha's expert decision to go ahead with c-sec came handy. I din't give any second thought and decided to go with her decision as I had already built enough of trust on her.My wife delivered on 18th November 2015 with a healthy baby boy. Both my wife & baby were fine and back from OT within 2 hours of post operation observation. Cloudnine provided a unique experience for expected father to be inside the OT and experience this unique new phase.Post delivery, I got a call from Dr. Shobha. She congratulated with her usual warm welcoming voice. It was really nice to hear her as I couldn't meet her post delivery. She also informed me that it was the best decision to go with c-sec as the chord connecting the mother to the baby had started wrapping around my baby's neck and because of that it was quite difficult for the natural delivery and hence the decision to go with c-sec was apt. I was really pleased of myself by trusting Dr. Shobha & going with her decision without any second thought.I really had a very nice & wonderful experience visiting Dr. Shobha. The only thing I regret now is not visiting her right at early stage of my wife's pregnancy. Nevertheless, I would like to give a big big thanks to her for her ever comforting voice, her amazing expertise and ever welcoming nature. You are the best!!!

Thank you!', ""Visited For Pregnancy Check UpI recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessTreatment satisfactionI am 36 year old and conceived naturally in July 2016, after having a miscarriage in Nov 2012. I never thought I could conceive again, but nature had other plans. I met Dr Shobha at Bhargavi clinic the day I learned that I am pregnant. I was very apprehensive about the chances of this pregnancy completing its term. Dr Shobha's words were very reassuring and she told me to leave everything to nature and pray to God. I did exactly what she advised me. I had gestational diabetes as well. I consulted the endocrynologist suggested by Dr Shobha and followed a very strict diet. I always met the Dr regularly and followed every advise religiously. All my test results throughout my pregnancy were within normal range. I never google searched myself or went for any second opinion regarding the test results in my pregnancy because I always thought that doctors know better than us. As I was busy at work, I could not exercise regularly. Hence I remained active at household chores as much as I could. I took all the calcium and Iron supplements on time and without fail. I had full faith in Dr Shobha and was prepared to undergo either normal delivery or C-section whichever the Dr felt right for me. Her words were always very encouraging. Finally, I had a normal delivery of just 2.5 hours of labour and I delivered a healthy baby girl. My two cents to all those who are planning for a pregnancy or going through a pregnancy - Please have full faith in your doctor, follow their advise religiously, Do not keep changing the doctor frequently, and take everything as it comes. I can't thank Dr Shobha enough for all her valuable guidance and support throughout my pregnancy and delivery."", ""I recommend the doctorHappy with: Explanation of the health issueDoctor friendlinessTreatment satisfactionWait timeValue for moneyBefore getting conceived, my wife was having PCO and we had consulted this doctor.

When the delivery time came my wife was too afraid to do normal delivery and she wasn't getting the pain even after 18 hours. She insisted on waiting and doing normally as it is good for both baby and mother. But finally, we ended up doing C-Section and got our cute boy out from the womb. Now he is 8 months old and filling our time and space with happiness around every minute.About the C-Section Procedure, first, it was just 5 - 10 mins, first is the injection for getting local anesthetic in the spine and then operation. I was quite surprised because before even I got dressed to go into the OT the procedure got over. It was comparatively less pain than normal but Post Operation she was having pain for one night.

After a long search and reading lot of reviews we got some confidence to meet and discuss our next course of action. Since day one we got good confidence on her and with every visit this confidence level increased and we decided to proceed for rest of the process with Dr. Namita Kapoor (with a regret why we didn't choose her since start).We liked the suggestions and the process she follows for whole consulting process to keep it as Natural as possible. And even when other doctors starts scaring with few natural minor complications like in our case for 1 loop round the neck and other doctors were scaring and forcing us to plan early delivery (cesarean post 32 week or 36 week max) because of this which was not necessary.Dr. Namita checked all the previous scans and reports and said because of this there is no need to plan early delivery. we can still wait till last day (with monitoring baby movements at home) and still Normal delivery can be tried. In case baby do not come down and heartbeat fluctuates while trying then on last day last option will be caesarean otherwise most of the cases Normal delivery is possible. We were convinced with the way she told at least she is still trying for normal delivery and there can be chance we can have baby delivered without caesarean.On the Day of delivery. She tried her level best to get baby delivered normally but we can see that every time its tried the baby heartbeat was fluctuating. So considering 2 complications (loop around the neck and baby poop in womb) and heartbeat fluctuation while trying for normal delivery we have to go for emergency caesarean delivery or it will be risk to the baby that we can understand.Our satisfaction was like Doctor tried her level best for normal delivery that was enough for us to still keep on continuing with Dr. Namita for any of our future need.

Being first time pregnant my mind was full of questions, concerns & useless unnecessary thought. But after consulting the Dr everything was cleared and my pregnancy journey throughout the baby delivery was smooth & planned.During these 9 months I got sick many a time but just one advice from the doctor worked like a charm and I recovered fast. The doctor was always reachable on watsapp/phone during the pregnancy starting 7th months because after this only the critical time of any pregnancy starts as per my experience.Initially after going through certain feedback on Practo saying the Dr. was little ruude to them I was also little sceptical but believe me I was proved wrong with each consultation.Since during the first 6-7 months & carrying the 1st baby our mind is full with thousand of unnecessary question so to take care of those the Dr. had to be like a teacher little strict & always caring to tell you what is right & what is wrong.And sometime we want to be told in a certain way that clears our doubt.And then comes the part when you feel connected with the doctor because of the motherly feeling you get when you are with her.My situation was that I was carrying a big baby inside me. My little princess was 4+ kg when she took birth. Still the Dr. left no stone turned to make sure that I go for a normal delivery rather than c-section. Till the due date I could not have my labor pain & there was no point of inducing me as the baby head was not fitted yet in my cervix. And because of this I had to go for a c-section on my 40th week 4th day of pregnancy.As the doctor also predicted before birth that the Baby is 4+ kg in weigh & it was proved to be correct.Believe me after 15 days of my operation when I think of all the wild thought & scariness I had for c-section all seems silly. It was all because of Dr. Namita Kapoor that my operation was so smooth it feels like a thing of long past already.Post operation day, I am able to manage my house chores, taking care of my baby all by myself.Already its a so faint scar on my bikini line that it doesn't look line I was ever operated (just passed 15 days from operation day). Now also doctor is always available on a phone call & watsapp (unlike other doctors).Doctors Care made me feel that I was in safe hands always. Coming to her is like dealing with trusted family.

Thankfully i was fully dialated in next 20 mins and baby heartbeat was constant. Dr. Namita closely monitored everything and took right decisions at that time.

She wanted to wait till my due date. But I was mentally very weak to bare the last month pain and restlessness. I have visited her atleast 3 times in 10 days in the tenth month. Everytime I visit her I will go with some complain that not able to breathe, sleep, eat, walk though I know that these all natural problems in the last month. She will console me and send back to home.Everytime we go, my husband used to ask too many questions. But she was so polite to answer everything.She also clearly explained the hospital procedures for delivery.Finally I ended up in c section in 38 weeks. I didn't want to take risk of normal delivery. My husband somehow convinced the doctor.Even during operation she told me that I could have waited for normal delivery becoz my previous scar has healed well.Throughout this 9 months she was very caring, approachable even at 11 PM n also strict abt my diet becoz of diabetes.I would highly recommend her for all."", ""Visited For PregnancyLabor and DeliveryCervical CerclageI recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionWait timeWith First Pregnancy every couple having certain expectation from the doctor and hospital service. The way Dr. Namita guided us at each stage, each passing week and giving the best of the advice which helped us to get a healthy and safe delivery with near to full term.During the initial scan we discovered that the pregnancy was with bicornuate uterus and in the right horn, this having a risk of early or pre-term labor and also impact baby's growth. Looking to this Dr. Namita suggested to go for a cervical cerclage. As this is very new to us and first time we are very skeptical about this and we did some online study to understand what are the Pros and Cons of doing a Cerclage, Honestly Cercalage is still not common in India and we hardly found any supportive or relevant feedback. (Most of them are from US or other part of world).We decided to trust the doctor and her experience and did a cervical cerclage and it has given a expected result as the Pregnancy able to cover near to full term (37 Week) with a normal growth for the baby.During the 37 week as we found that due to some impact on Liver we need to take a decision to hold till 40 Week and wait for labor or to go for a C-sec as this liver dysfunctioning can cause health issue with mother. Dr. Namita discussed all possibilities with us and we decided to go for C-sec as baby is fully grown and we do not want to risk mother health.On the final day Dr. Namita spent an hour with us explaining about the C-sec and pre and post procedure and risk. (Which you hardly expect in India by any doctor).To summarize we high appreciate and thank full to Dr. Namita to be there and advising us to have the most precious gift of life.With sincere thanks from Swati, Tarun & Little Hridaya."", 'Visited For Pregnancy Check UpI recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionValue for moneyWait time""Brilliant"" is what sums up the entire experience we had with Dr.Namita, over the course of a year. We got her reference from Practo itself and based on the review experience and ratings, we decided to go to her initially. Being apprehensive as all to-be parents are, we were not sure of anything in the beginning. But after a couple of visits we were confidant of one thing, if not anything else, that she would be the doctor we wanted to continue for the entire time. Dr. Namita is straight-forward and precise to a point where it might be considered rude by some, but in our experience we realized that, this specific attribute is what we required to be in our doctor. She would not spend time in unnecessary details and explanation not pertinent to the well-being of the baby and the parent. Our session with her were short, precise, to the point and detailed with respect to relevance. She never prescribed any test or medicines which would not be imperative to the baby\'s or mothers health and constructive progress throughout the course of 9 months. She specifically mentioned what and where to do the test and not to go for any unnecessary expenses. My wife gave birth to our beautiful daughter at exactly 40 + 1 week. Dr.Namita‚Äôs support was the maximum at the end. We had opted for a normal delivery, she also supported the same. For my wife however, the pain did not come on its own, even on the due date, Dr.Namita was fully patient and wanted to wait for normal, and went for an induced pain. After 3 inducements, my wife started responding, it was almost 24 hours the contraction pain started, it was taking her a long time to go into labor, but Dr Namita was willing to wait even more and explained everything to us in pristine detail. It was completely our decision to go for a C-section, even though she told us there‚Äôs a good possibility of a normal delivery, only it would require little more time. Once our decision was done and confirmed she took my wife to the OT. Within 15-20 min the operation was done and my wife and our daughter came out all well and healthy. Even on the 2 days my wife was admitted for recovery, Dr.Namita came on regular visits checked her thoroughly and prescribed very little medicine. She was discharged from the hospital within 2 days all healthy and fine.As I mentioned above, the experience was nothing short of brilliant in every aspect with full support and precise treatment.Thank you Dr. Namita.', 'Visited For PregnancyI recommend the doctorHer words after my normal delivery "" You did it the way God has designed you to do so"" were so soothing and reassuring . We thanked God for choosing Dr Namita for our child\'s delivery.Being New to Bangalore we did not had any idea which hospital is good and which Gynac to consult . We walked in to Columbia Asia hospital with a fear( I believe all have this fear ) that whether we are making a right choice and whether we will get a good doctor , today we feel vindicated that we made a perfect choice .When we first met her , we found her very friendly and knowledgeable, with whom we could discuss any issues we faced . She was available on call anytime and in case she was not available on call you could easily send her an message and she responded to each and every query .Also she never suggested any unnecessary tests and advised us very correctly in case of physiotherapy and other pregnancy related costs.During the course of pregnancy she guided us on every minute thing to take care of and become more of a caring friend then a doctor . As we desired for a normal delivery she suggested what all will be helpful . And truly each and every of her advise helped .During the last trimester she gave us a clear way ahead preparing us for a course of delivery and the best caring part of her was that she told us that I am available 24X7 now ( on phone text or in person) . And we could call her at any odd hour whenever we felt some issue was there .In my 9th month due to some complications ( Liver been impacted) Dr Namita took a wise decision to prepone my delivery by 3 weeks and I delivered a healthy angel by normal delivery.Even after delivery she readily answers our queries on phone and whatsapp even though we have shifted to Delhi now .With this brief testimony we would thank to D Namita and would say when we look back without a hint of doubt I will say Dr Namita is one of the best Gynac .A Big Thank You and God Bless you .

Suggesting a Proposed line of treatment: Hysteroscopy with D And C and explaining in detail the full implications in a soft assuring tone -I could see Dr. Vimla possessed the three fundamental qualities one looks for in a doctor - credibility, professionalism, and ethics. Once the Hysteroscopy with D and C was carried out - and examining the test reports it became clear that a hysterectomy was also needed. Once again we were in the safest hands and Dr Vimla followed a very thorough process of taking the inputs of an eminent Neurologist and an equally eminent Physician, this covering all other implications before moving ahead with the line of treatment. Dr. Vimla has a highly skilful hand and in all her procedures and she takes extra care to make the process as painless as possible.When I exchanged notes with my relations and friends and heard some of the most horrifying experiences - even as I relax on the bed in post operative care , I felt a compulsive urge to let women know that such post-menopausal treatments need not be a torture in terms of physical , psychological or economic hardship.

And also the guidance on contraceptives methods were also a part of the procedure.so she asked us to come back and take an ultrasound after a week or so of the procedure at Apollo only. we went there on time only to find out she wasn't there and probably was on vacation. we still didn't mind and had a call with her. the way she talked was not the same as she was talking before the amount was paid( actually we told, we were leaving the city soon, so would be better if she can meet or guide us further on contraception, she replied- just because u are leaving the city does not change my procedure). after the call, we went and asked the receptionist about the ultrasound. ohh God, the service that clinic provides is very bad, nobody pays attention to the patients, faced total ignorance from the entire team and the guy who was to do the ultrasound. after a long verbal spat, they kind of sent us to some other diagnostic centre. things at that diagnostic centre were fine.so after the ultrasound and after few days, i was facing some serious depression, which i wanted to discuss with the doctor and thought may be she could give some input , but there wasn't any reply. i ignored and went on to ask about the contraceptive methods which she told she would definitely help with as its part of the procedure. messages were getting read , but i never got a single reply from her.but the same doc until payment was done was replying to me normally. * ***** **** **** **** *** * *** **** **** ******* ***** **** ****** * *** *** *** **** * ********* ***** **** **** *** **** *** ********Dr. Vanita Vaishnav replied1. MTP is a medico-legal procedure. Has to be done at registered place by the registered doctor. 2. I gave ypu an option of Apollo as it is registered for MTP , plus it was meeting your requirements of having everything( consult and scan) at the same place. 3. I had given you a very clear picture of the MTP package, with inclusions and exclusions. It's pre decided by the clinic. Doctors don't interfere and don't don't have any say in it. 4. Every absence from the clinic doesn't mean vacation. It can be emergencies( personal or professional). And like you said you had travel plan, doctors also have their plans and holidays. And as I said to you- I wouldnt prefer to change my clinical guidelines and procedure methods based on patients personal issues. If your yravel plan was more important than the MTP, you are free to decide accordingly. 5. I share my number for Real emergencies and sharing reports. I prefer in person discussion for other queries. 6. I gave you the contraceptive advise. You were always free to ask more if it wasn't clear or you wanted other advise. 7. Depression - happened a month later after your MTP. Treating depression isn't my clinical qualification... And replying to such messages also isn't medicolegally advised for us. There can be various reasons for depression. Would suggest you to meet a clinician for the same. 8. Feel free to go to a pharmacy and take the treatment . I gave you options, and you chose doctor and clinic. I hope all your queries are answered. Wish you safery and good health."", 'Visited For PCOD/PCOS TreatmentI recommend the doctorAmazing doctor.

She tried to call me once and due to Practo app issue I was not audible to her. After that she didn‚Äôt try to call me again and my queries where simple which should have been clarified over msgs. Very unfriendly behaviour. I am not sure about in clinic visit but would not recommend online consultation with her. Unhappy with Practo and doctor experience.Dr. Suman Singh repliedFirst of all you are a very confused person yourself who keeps changing her requirements for period management repeatedly. After our consultation(have closed it after one hour not in 7 minutes!!) and explaining how to take the medicines to manage your periods, then you send me multiple messages during the follow up with each message more confusing than the next. You don't even have the courtesy to write the dates properly, you are using an American system and interchanging the day and the month adding to the confusion as your message is incomplete and with every message you are wanting to use a different permutation of the medicine prescribed as per your whims and fancies. I had to spend so much additional time trying to understand your messages again and again ,finally I got fed up and I tried to call you but you were not connected on the app because of which I could not get through to you .Nonetheless I redid my prescription to suit your new requirements. Instead of wasting your time and my time writing such a lengthy feedback it would have been much better if you had put more thought into your consultation in the first place and neatly written down your requirements when we had asked you to do so.If you were better organised the confusion and rework wouldnt have been necessary. Writing multiple messages back to back during evening OPD hours will not help as I have only two hands to work with and the only condition on which I accept these online consultations on Practo is that I should be able to respond to them at a time that I am free ,after I have attended to my clinic patients. If you do not have the patience to wait for a follow up response and expect an immediate response,let me inform you that it is not possible.We have been allotted 24 hrs to respond by Practo. You are quick to call us unfriendly(because of delay in follow up) but I just find your whole attitude towards me rather rude and ungrateful especially when I was running high temperature and still working beyond my capacity to attend to your umpteen changes in requests. Most of you are not even aware of what you are entitled to in a Practo online consultation and unnecessarily keep ordering us to call you back which is also out of line. Fed up with the unreasonable demands that people have on these online consultations I have reduced it drastically to spare me the headaches of these online consultations.

Our first visit was around at 7 weeks and followed by at 12 weeks. During 7 weeks of scan Dr. has confirmed the twin pregnancy and 12 weeks reports were completely normal with Monochorionic Diamniotic Twin Pregnancy (Twin share same placenta). Everything was going healthy and as recommended by Dr. , we went for next checkup/scan at around 20 weeks. During the initial scanning by Junior Dr. they got some doubt and after detailed scanning by senior specialists, they have confirmed that twins has developed ""Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome""-Stage III; a rare pregnancy condition where one twin gives away more blood/nutrients than it receives in return and another one receives too much . If untreated both the babies will die eventually due to organ failure -possibly within one or two weeks. However, as per the suggestion of Dr. Asha and team we went to BFMC and did the Fetal Laser Ablation surgery within 1 week. Yes, obviously everything went well and the surgery was successful and again we visited Dr. Asha at around 27 weeks. Again after there were few complications like severe itching (Liver Cholestasis) in body, low hemoglobin level, Gestational diabetes etc. which Dr. Asha managed very efficiently. There are many instances in which she had guided us through WhatsApp message/call without any hesitation, even after normal working hours. Finally after our last ultrasound scanning Dr. had advised us to get admitted after 7 days and did some routine blood test. Report came one the same day night in which platelet count for my wife was around 80000 against the normal value of 2.5 lacs. Dr. Asha intervened immediately at 10 pm and directed the Motherhood Lab to do the test again. Obviously same report came within 1 hour which I received by WhatsApp itself. Dr. was doubting it could lead to HELLP syndrome and advised us to get admitted on the same night. Next day afternoon Dr. Asha did the cesarean delivery with two healthy babies. Yes, as I am writing this post after 4 months, both the babies are healthy and growing well. So I would recommend her and would go back if needed. 10 stars from my side.', ""Visited For Pregnancy Check UpI recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionI was recommended to check Dr Asha Hiremath back in 2014 when I was struggling with different Gynaes suggesting procedures - higher revenue potential than conservative treatments.

My wife had been suffering from severe pain due to an ovarian endometriotic cyst. We‚Äôve consulted numerous Doctors in Bangalore, but couldn‚Äôt narrow down to anyone due to various reasons such as ‚Äì trust, intention (financial or service minded approach) etc. We almost gave up until we decided to check one last time, at Aster CMI Hospital, Hebbal. Turned out the best decision we ever made. We went through Dr.Chetana V‚Äôs profile on Aster and Practo, and felt the need to pay a visit. The very moment we stepped into her consultation room, without even uttering a word, we knew Dr.Chetana is THE ONE! So calm, composed, intelligent, assuring ‚Äì I‚Äôm lost for words to describe her sheer brilliance! My wife and I were wondering why in the world did we explore all of Bangalore when the answer to all our worries was just 7kms away from our home! Dr.Chetana described my wife‚Äôs condition in detail and exact steps to address it. She is so experienced and skilled that with a look of her reports, she knew exactly what she was dealing with, and the precise actions needed to resolve it. We were stunned by her brilliance! Dr.Chetana has a wonderful team of Junior Doctors and nurses at Aster Hospital who work exactly in sync with Doctor, further enhancing our wonderful experience. The Junior Doctors under Doctor Chetana, sisters, nurses, housekeeping staff etc..literally everyone in Dr.Chetana‚Äôs team who fall under Aster‚Äôs ‚ÄòBirthing Center‚Äô need to be applauded for their service minded approach and sincere concern for their patients. I‚Äôm yet to see any hospital or Doctor meet these standards, it‚Äôs just mind-blowing! Doctor Chetana and her brilliant team treated my wife‚Äôs condition via laparoscopic surgery. The surgery was so perfectly done that my wife woke up and started walking the very next morning! Dr.Chetana is a miracle, a TRUE MIRACLE! We have no words to express our gratitude to everyone at Aster. Therefore, we decided to express our gratitude in the form of a huge appreciation email to the COO and Head of OBG (Aster CMI Hospital), where we will be detailing every task performed to the tee of each person/team within Aster, which made my wife and I gaze in awe! Our heartfelt gratitude again to Dr.Chetana and Team.

Dr A K Gupta sir spoke to me on phone and heard the medical issues faced by my mother and then he advised if i can visit his pritampura clinic that is nearest to my home in North Delhi. After informing Dr A K Gupta that my mother is on Oxygen support 24 by 7 and is in an extremely critical medical condition, i enquired and requested if Dr AK Gupta on humanitarian grounds could come to visit my mother at Hospital where in she is admitted. Dr AK Gupta unlike other Allopathic doctors , understanding the seriousness of the medical complications and sensing extreme pain, hopelessness in my voice as son , ageed to personallly visit the hospital. Dr AK Gupta as a medical expert knowing the emergency medical condition did not delayed and the very next day made visit to the hospital, met my mother, understood and heard her medical issues, examined her, counselled her and above all gave her a ray of hope and confidence to my mother and to myself and with confidence stated that ""edema and respiratory issues will get treated and she will be fine"" and above all he counselled me and my mother, listened to my mother and did not in any way showed off that he is running short of time or is in a hurry .

I am a cosmetic dentist and a surgeon. I start and finish root canal with cap placement. In between one session is always done by root Canal specialist (not any junior doctor). If root canal fails, it is due to chronic infection,means if patient comes to us with late infection stage ,root canal cannot be guaranteed. At our clinic we do 100-150 root canals monthly out of which 5-10 can fail because poor prognosis of tooth. And it is same in all clinics of the world.

He came across as a person who was very much passionate about what he does but his knowledge about his field was massively impressive. He not only explained to me very clearly and in simple terms about the status of my current situation but also explained what the possible alternatives at this stage were along with their pros and cons - further more he was also very much patient and bearing towards the plethora of questions I had and not once did he ridicule my concern. He strongly suggested against getting the upper wisdom tooth extracted as it was seeming to be in a good state.He walked me through the extraction procedure in great detail and was very much up front about the pain aspect of it. He explained what all he would do to mitigate it prior to starting the procedure and he also informed me about what to expect post the procedure as well. Given his carring attitude and the depth of his explanation, I agreed to getting it done right away.Post the procedure, I followed his instructions to the dot and I literally had no swelling what so ever!

I am writing this so that it might help similar patients like me, who are confused about treatment? When I was a child, one of my front teeth broke during playing. My front tooth was replaced by the dental bridge. That bridge was not good in look, moreover, fitting was so bad that I lived my life in a delusion that my mouth structure is such that my lips are not closing properly. After 11 years, I decided to do something about this bridge. I visited Dr. Mridula in May 2017. She checked my dental bridge and recommended for a change of dental bridge with zirconia premium. I went ahead with this procedure and replaced my old bridge with zirconia bridge. The outcome is very good. Now it looks natural and perfectly fitted.

I was very apprehensive as I had had a very painful extraction 2 years ago by another doctor. But at the very first meeting, he made feel very comfortable and confident with his positive talk and smiling attitude. When I visited him 2 days later with my sugar report and OPG he assured me that it was a very simple procedure and that I should report at Siraj dental clinic the following morning. I too went there the next morning with a very positive attitude, but I didn't expect it to be so painless. I didn't even feel the injection prick and in 10 minutes flat the procedure was done. Absolutely and totally painless. I still thought once the numbness wears off, I would feel the pain. But honestly there was just a little discomfort for the first few hours which a single painkiller took care of. I could eat normally 2 hours after the procedure.

Recommended for sure for age related issues', ""I recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionValue for moneyWait timeTwo months into our marriage, my spouse, who is 29 years old, complained of a headache and haziness in front of his eyes. As I was new to Bangalore, I looked up online for a good neurologist and found Dr. Krishnan's address. He suggested an MRI to eliminate all extreme possibilities. Because my spouse is claustrophobic, we requested him for an alternative, but he insisted on it. And I can't be thankful enough to him for this. Through the MRI, we found out that what we had been dismissing as a migraine, at the most, turned out to be a blood clot in the watershed region of the brain. In short, my spouse had suffered a minor brain stroke. The moment I got to know this, I called up Dr. Krishnan. We fixed an appointment with him, and he patiently explained everything to us. Further, he made sure that we went for the relevant tests to find out the cause behind it, even though he was able to guess that it was B12 deficiency. In the meanwhile, he put my spouse on medicines to gradually dissolve the clot and prevent any recurrence. The test results were able to eliminate many possible causes and indicated that the stroke was probably induced by a B12 deficiency only. He immediately prescribed him B12 injections and asked us to make some lifestyle changes.A brain stroke is not something that one hears of often, so you can imagine how panicked and scared we were when we found out about it. But we are so lucky that we have had Dr. Krishnan's guidance and expertise with us every step of the way. He has been so patient, friendly and prompt throughout. I can't thank him enough for this.It has been almost a year since the stroke, and by God's grace, my spouse is doing fine. As is usual after a stroke, he is still on a blood thinner and some preventive medicines, but these don't affect his normal life functioning in any way.I super-recommend Dr. Krishnan, and hope that my story gives hope to anyone who is reading it. :)Dr. P.R.

I was admitted to the Sri Sathya Sai Super Speciality Hospital Whitefield, Banglore in the year 2012 after my first paralytic attack which of course was a very late diagnosis unfortunately due to the absence of any other visible symptoms till then. The MRI reports revealed that lesions in my brain & spinal cord were eight year old (chronic lesions) and the directionality of the disease at that stage was such that I would be fully paralysed below chest and confine to a wheelchair at any point of time in future according to the western medical science. But then came a divine intervention in my life in the form of Dr. Joshy E V who not only treated me with love and care but also helped me in living a normal life by reversing back from the clutches of MS attack because of his judicious combination of allopathy and holistic treatment. Being a Biology teacher by profession I\'m now leading a perfectly normal and healthy life. I\'m also a proud father of two children, that too after my paralytic attack. In fact I have written and published a book on 23rd February 2020 entitled \' ""MS"" to"" My Sai""... A journey with Sai\', with the soul intention of giving courage and solace to all chronic Neuro patients by taking them to the level of quantum healing which is 100%possible if you get a blessed doctor like Dr. Joshy E V.

I had started developing pain and swelling on my right neck region which further spread to my shoulder, back, head, ear, arm, hand, palm and fingers; all on the right side. After running from general physician, ENT, dentist and orthopaedic; and multiple medicines, I decided to consult with Dr. Advait for the unbelievably positive reviews on Practo. Hence, I went to him and got a sense of relief when he said that it\'s nothing serious, removed my previous medication, prescribed me physiotherapy at his clinic for 10 days and just one vitamin tablet. Being far from my place and not having a private vehicle, I chose to take physiotherapy at a clinic 2mins away from my home. According to Dr. Advait I was fit to start working post 4-5days of my consultation with him, but surprisingly my physiotherapist recommended 7 days of complete bed rest as my condition was really severe and had become chronic. Once done with physio, I resumed work and in an hour of working, my pain had come back. This time so severe that I couldn\'t bear, I had no choice but to continue with shortened hours for one more day until my right hand felt completely weak and as if I had lost all sensation. I couldn\'t even have food. My physiotherapist recommended getting a scan and asked me to check with Dr. Advait once. I went for the follow up the same day, that\'s today and I was asked to pay 1k as consultation although it was just a follow-up. I denied.Now, the moment I sat I started speaking of my issues and was worried.

I started calling up people, in the meantime I was asked twice by the receptionist to hurry up as (their words) Dr. Advait had called twice if I had done my scan or to pay the consultation. Multiple phone calls later, things felt not very reliable and decided to go to a ****** hospital to get my scan done.

She had high sugar, bp, hypertension, diabetic and overweight. After visiting 3 specialist neuro surgeon, with no result we finally met Dr Anirudh on recommendation from a different person. Doctor was able to diagnose that she was suffering from Cushing syndrome.Cushing‚Äôs disease make it very hard for an observer to truly understand how complex the disease really is.With Cushing‚Äôs disease, the adenoma causes the pituitary gland to release too much ACTH. ACTH stimulates production and release of cortisol, a stress hormone. Too much ACTH causes the adrenal glands to make too much cortisol, causing all of the terrible symptoms.The doctor helped us understand why the other doctors were not able to diagnose this and he took time out to help us what is the way forward and made us patiently understand the severity and rareness of this syndrome. We decided to go ahead with the surgery which is removal of pituitary gland in Dec 2019 and after one year post surgery, my mother is back to normal, she is able to walk on her own, no bp, insulin dosage has drastically reduced, cortisol levels are normal.All thanks to Dr Anirudh and the team of other doctors who conducted this surgery.

Here‚Äôs a brief history of my condition when I visited her ‚ÄìI had been a user of soft, disposable contact lenses for more than 10 years when one unpleasant morning, I woke up to red, swollen eyes, hazy vision, and a change in the colour of my eyes. I was in considerable pain that particular day and would rate the pain as 2 on a scale of 10. Following that day, I consulted two Ophthalmologists in the city ‚Äì Dr. Regi Thomas and Sanghamitra Burman, the former being associated with St. Johns while the latter was attached with Vasan Eye Care. My condition continued to roll downhill and my vision got hazier and eyes weirder. One would put me on strong steroids while another would ask me to exercise my eye muscles and want me to stop bothering with my eyes ‚Äì to her, the pain I was going was of little significance. Whatever I did, my discomfort started to engulf me. Thankfully, a friend recommended a great ophthalmologist at Manipal Hospital who like I mentioned earlier happened to be the Head of the Department of Ophthalmology too at that time ‚Äì Dr. Ajanta Chakravarty.Extremely patient with her subjects and eager to understand their symptoms, Ajanta Chakravarty immediately had me as her admirer! Besides patiently listening to me, she smiled and assured me that she‚Äôs going to bring me a smile very soon!Before putting me on crazy dosages of medicines considering the serious condition of my eye, she instead probed my symptoms and tried to understand the root of the problem which in my opinion every doctor should. She changed my diet and added fruits and vegetables that are rich in Vitamin C, supplemented my diet with Vitamin C, and put me on a general antibiotic eye drop combined with a lubricating eye drop. Though my body was dealing with the infection in a better way with the help of the heavy supplements of Vitamin C in my diet, I wasn‚Äôt feeling well.My eye started to deteriorate and a grey circle started to appear around my eyeball suddenly one fine night. I was at Manipal at 9 in the morning the next day waiting to be see the first. I was collapsing from the pain and my eye was so swollen that I had difficulty wearing my glasses. She was appalled on seeing my condition and immediately ordered a scrape test on my eye where they would scrape tissues from my eye and send them to the lab to get to the root of the problem. The painful procedure was finally done and reports were inconclusive.

So net 1 hour delay to meet the doctor.- Not too confident on the power checked by the assistant, normal checkups at Titan Eye Plus and Lenskart had both showed no change in power (exact match) whereas here both the eyes something had changed. Now it might be that both of those guys were wrong, but I would rather get a check again to be certain.- Doctor did not check the power for himself. Not sure if that is the norm these days, but at least till a year back the doctor always rechecked the power.- Doctor appeared pretty casual about everything, like nothing seems to matter. Probably tired too. He wanted me to come again for a proper checkup since the eye drops would take 30 minutes to show effect. After waiting from 7:30 to 8:30 doing nothing, I am told that it will take another 30 minutes for the eye drop to take effect. Do I have to state the obvious that this could have been done much earlier?

Second thing you mentioned about i assigned all my job to nurse , kindly do some research before posting some thing which is totally irrelevant , throughout the world wherever you go its the standard protocol that there are something known as paramedical staff, they are well trained in their field , their job is to help the doctors therefore to reduce the time duration of hospital stay for the patient. same thing applies to writing the prescription by the paramedical staff, and doctor will document in the hospital record. Third thing you mentioned about doctor was in another room busy with his phone, i appreciate that you are able to keenly observe everything at the hospital, but you failed to know the fact that there was elective surgeries posted at 6 pm in my clinic , that needs to be informed to medical staff at the hospital, anaesthetist, including the patients relatives.

The crowns that were fixed on that didn't last for more than 3-4 days. We again went there and fixed it twice or thrice. She only blamed the kid saying that she is always trying pull it out thats why it is coming out. As the crowns were coming out several times *** **** ****** ** *** **** ** ******* *** ***** ************ i also contacted different dentists to check the issue and understood that the issue is, the crown doesn't have a proper base to stick to the tooth as she made it very small. This was the scariest thing as the crown was coming out when the kid was having food. No medical emergency happened as my daughter was very careful while eating. Later i checked with other dentists and decided that i will not fix those crowns and made sure that the filling is proper. It was just that i lost 10000 rs only for crowns. After 2 months, my daughter started to get swelling on one of the tooth which had undergone half root canal treatment. As i have moved abroad, i showed it to one of the dentist here and they have referred me to a dental surgeon as it looks like there is some damage in the underlying nerves due to the earlier treatment and it is creating issues. After spending 25000-30000 rs on my daughter's teeth already in Bangalore, my kid have to again undergo so many more treatments and pains again. This is something that is not acceptable at all.

Thank you for your feedback and to raise your concern. I have treated your son in July 2019, when he came with history of pain at night time and he had a swelling in the gum in relation to his upper front tooth. The needful treatment plan and cost was explained to you and the treatment was begun. The root canal of your child was completed only after symptoms of pain and swelling had resolved. You are aware of the treatment as in January 2019 your daughter too underwent the same treatment from me. In the same appointment I had explained how to care for the tooth and be vigilant, and if the filling comes out it has to be refilled. In September 2019 you came to me that the filling had come out and the needful was done and only consultation was charged. At this point of time too I had told you to be vigilant and check for the filling while brushing his teeth. Some times in young children the front tooth filling may come out and the cause could be any trauma (hurt, not necessarily a fall), biting hard foods, having very sticky chocolates and foods, grinding of teeth, etc. So when you visited me in Jan 2020, the child had a swelling in the gum, and you were relieved to show the child to me. You did not have a prior appointment, but as always I allow walk in patients and you did not have any much waiting time. The tooth was examined and I asked about history of any fall or hurt, the filling was not present and you mentioned he had this pain since one day. X ray was taken and due to infection and open canal the root canal filling paste was resorbed/ had come out. (it does happen in case of infection). Child was all comfortable and cleaning and irrigation of the canal was done and the abscess was drained and area well irrigated and canal received a cotton dressing. Required medication were prescribed and you were asked to come after 3 days for follow-up and I shall attend to your child first, and you could just walk in. Consultation charge was taken and a nominal fee for abscess drainage and Xray combined. Treatment rendered to your child was of best of our ability and followed the standard protocol. You are welcome to get your child for the completion of his treatment. Wishing the best always and ready to help.', 'Visited For Broken TeethI recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionDoctor did proper analysis and explained as on various options like root canal or tooth removal for my 6 year old son who had broken and decayed teeth and gums were growing on top of that teeth.
