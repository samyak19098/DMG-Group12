Although I got a temporary restoration for it, my smile has never been the same. Not only did this affect my smile but also my speech. I was recommended to Dr. Rajat Sachdeva‚Äôs clinic by a friend of mine. After a long hiatus between my dental visits, I was apprehensive and very nervous but I can say that I had the best experience at Dr. Rajat‚Äôs clinic as he made me most comfortable and relaxed. He suggested me to go for an implant for my missing tooth, and based on my CBCT scans, it was the best option for me. So, I decided to choose a single dental implant. Since it was the front tooth and had significant effect on my smile, the dentist was extremely careful and meticulously planned the entire treatment. I was even shown the end-result and it looked very promising. I was called in early on the day of surgery, and the entire procedure did not even take an hour. It was completely painless and minimally invasive. I was able to see the procedure as it was being done on the screen, and it was later given to me as my dental record. The attention to details and executing the treatment to perfection would definitely be the stand-outs of this clinic. The practice is very professional and compassionate at the same time. Throughout the process, everything was described in detail as to the road ahead, the timescale of all future visits, the costs which were spread over the whole dental treatment and the follow up visits and regular checking on all dental issues. After the procedure, I was given a temporary restoration so that I wouldn‚Äôt be toothless. My final crown came a few weeks later and it fitted like a glove. The shape, size and color of the crown was just like my other tooth, and it perfectly blended in. My speech was also clearer, the lisp was gone and I finally had a clear diction. This was truly the best possible outcome that I expected to achieve with my implant. Dr. Rajat‚Äôs clinic is truly a perfect place for getting your dental problems treated.

Dr. Rajat‚Äôs dental clinic in Ashok Vihar can be truly called a representation of painless dentistry.Owing to years of neglect and malfunction, I had ended up with a rather unpleasant smile. I had a few missing teeth and several of them were completely worn out. When I consulted Dr. Rajat with my issues, he was very supportive and motivated me to go for a full mouth smile makeover. Before we moved forward with my case, a CBCT scan was advised which revealed in-and-out of my teeth and jaws. Based on the interpretations of these scans, Dr. Rajat formulated the treatment plan; which consisted of many procedures which included rehabilitation of missing teeth, crowns and veneers for worn-out teeth and to fill the gaps between my upper front teeth. Most of teeth were decayed and had to be restored as well.As the treatment started, I was made quite comfortable and even the complex of the procedures like placement of implants were done effortlessly. In all my appointments, the chair time did not exceed for more than an hour and that just shows the expertise of your treating dentist. Emax and Zirconia crowns were fabricated using CAD CAM software and the value they added to my aesthetics was substantial.Several of my teeth were decayed, few of which needed root canal treatments. Lasers was used to eliminate the infection completely and quickly too. It was definitely reassuring to be able to watch the procedure done on your teeth, and Dr. Rajat made it possible by use of dental microscopes. I could actually see what exactly went in and came out of those tiny canals. The evolution of dentistry never ceased to amaze me.For the final touch, I underwent a teeth whitening procedure using Philips Zoom! equipment. It is a rather magical technique, for the results were eminent immediately. Overall, I can say that Dr. Rajat has worked wonders with my smile and I can only than him and his team for my newfound confidence. Not only that, my function has also improved considerably and I can now bite into my favorite foods without any fear of sensitivity or pain.

As a result, my teeth had completely lost its luster and became dull. I had tried a number of at home remedies for teeth whitening like lemon and vinegar but nothing worked much. When I finally decided to take a professional help, I started to search a good dentist near me.Dr. Sachdeva's Dental clinic had many positive reviews on Google and had carried out multiple successful whitening procedures. So I consulted him and he advised me zoom whitening. The most important thing that he warned me was that the procedure would be a success if only I followed post-operative instructions like no smoking for at least a month and no chromogemic beverages like tea or coffee for a week. It was good to understand the technique and its outcome before I finalize it.The procedure was rather simple and completely pain free. Once they apply the bleaching gel, it is activated using LED light-accelerated technology which almost instantly whitens your teeth. The process was repeated four times until I got the desired shade. The results are seen almost immediately and improves over the due course. I got about 5 shades brighter teeth on the very same day. I couldn't believe it until I saw it myself. Dr. Rajat has done fantastic work with my teeth and I am really grateful for that.

He is a renowned cosmetic dentist in Ashok Vihar, Delhi. He informed me that these yellowish stains on the teeth are normal and may result due to multiple factors like from age, food and beverages. When he suggested Philips Zoom whitening procedure, I readily agreed because it has a good reputation and it is one of the best tooth whitening kits in the market.I had to get a scaling procedure done at first where they cleaned the plaque and tartar on my teeth. This was done so that the whitening procedure would be effective. The procedure began by covering my lips and gums and only my teeth were exposed. This was done apparently to protect them from the UV light. Zoom whitening gel was applied onto my teeth and a zoom light was shone which helped activate the gel. The gel remained on my teeth for maybe 15-20 minutes. They repeated this procedure thrice after which a desensitizing fluoride gel was applied to reduce sensitivity.The entire process of teeth whitening using Philips Zoom whitening procedure took about just an hour and the results were mind-blowing. My teeth looked significantly whiter and my smile was radiant. I would like to thank Dr. Rajat and his team for their incredible work with my teeth. I really appreciate it.

The staff are well-trained too and were very supportive throughout the process.The procedure basically starts with a routine cleaning of the teeth after which the actual whitening procedure commences. They apply a bleaching gel containing hydrogen peroxide which is then activated using LED light. This process is repeated for around four times, depending on the shade you want or amount of discoloration. You can listen to a relaxing music while the gel does its magic.

This further gave me confidence,as for me Dr Sourabh was very young.*My motive was to get good friendly treatment as overtime I felt that my dentist in Chicago was over charging unnecessarily and was still not giving sufficient time and attention too,probably bcoz of over occupancy.

Root canal was declared to be 'not possible' after two long, invasive and painful sittings! The very next day i consulted a senior dentist who immediately located the canals and successfully completed the root canal. At Matrix it was the most painful and panic ridden time I ever experienced on the dental table. **** *** *** **** ********** ********** ********* *** the best is, the dentist perforated the non-canal areas of the tooth ***** ** ******* ******* Dubious and unreliable messaging. ********* ** **** ** ****** ****** The most abysmal dental experience of my life! *** **** ******* ***** ** ***** * * ***** ** ********* ***********"", 'Visited For Tooth SensitivityI do not recommend the doctorHoped for better: Explanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionValue for money** *** **** ** ********** ******* **** ******** ******* ***** ****** ** *** ****** **** ***** ******* ** *** ***** *** **** * ***** *********** ***** **** *** ** ****** **** * ****** ***** *** * ****** ******** ** **** ******** *** ** *** *** * **** ****** Now, that\'s only the first part of the process.He is also not very transparent about the charges either. Now you will ask how much you will have to dish out for that and he will display a chart that says an X amount. And you will think that\'s how much I am spending for it. But wait, that\'s only the token amount. He will keep bringing additional charges for various stages of the root canal process. For instance after 3 visits, he will say something like"" now i will have to insert a fiber support to strengthen your teeth. That will cost an additional 6K or something"". If that was a part of the root canal process that should already have been included in the bill amount.Anyways, now is the time for crowning. Either you opt for a metallic crown or a ceramic. I opted for the ceramic one with a 5 years warranty. But when it was time for me to get the crown fitted, he said ""the 5 year cover has recently become invalid so I have made the 10 year plan for you. This will cost you 3K extra"". I didn\'t make much of a fuss about it back then because it was already at the back of my mind to go for the years plan. But still I felt like he should have at least given me a prior update and taken my consent before going ahead with the new plan. What if I wasn\'t willing to dish away the additional charges?Now after almost 3 months I still feel although very minimal but still some kind of a sensitivity in my crowning area. I also opted for deep cleaning. Even here he chose to give a miss to those areas where it\'s not visible. And now as I got a reminder from Matrix Dental Clinic via Practo for a routine/follow up check I decided to review the place and inform that I don\'t know about others but ""I am finding another dentist for my future visits"".I am still giving it a 2 rather than 1 star because the receptionist was acooperative and sensible lady.', 'Visited For Wisdom Tooth ExtractionSurgical Tooth Extraction Teeth cleaning & polishingI recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionWe went there for our daughter(6 yrs old). Many doctor suggested RCT for her problem which is quite painful. So, we were really not sure about that but thankfully, we discussed it with Dr Saurabh Nagpal.

I must say he is artist scientifically designing smiles. I atleast saw around 10-12 patients walking out with a all together new smile. Initially I was reluctant but when I met so many happy females of my age group I somehow got convinced but was scared till last appointment but more or less it was as if something was destined and Dr NAGPAL was well aware of what results can be attained. So it was his skill which made all this possible. You will hardly find anybody who got such a treatment done but it was nice that I got good smile that too without braces and best thing I liked was that doc gave me smile exactly resembling the pic that I showed him from a magazine. All in all I am delighted and excited and all credits and salutes to this marvelous dentist couple Dr Sourabh Nagpal and Dr Poonam Nagpal.
