I was looking for a doctor who would be honest with me from the start without any sugar coating, someone who wouldn't put me on unnecessary medications and trust my decisions and birthing plan. I saw Dr. Mukta in my 6th week of pregnancy and there on it was a very comfortable journey for me. Dr. Mukta is friendly, keeps it simple and states facts. Even though I had clot and bleed scare early on, she remained calm, got me to do the required scan and advised bed rest for two weeks. Coming to the last part of my pregnancy, even though my scan showed accelerated baby growth (baby was 3.5kgs at Birth) and Dr thought normal delivery would be challenging she fully supported my decision of trying normal birth and with God's grace, took it to the end. Her confidence and expertise was literally seen when she led the team in my labour room and helped me bring my baby boy into the earthside!

All the credit goes to her who was very supportive and helpful from my first day visit till today post delivery.I do not have any history of blood pressure. But I faced high BP during my hospital visit whereas when monitored at home , it was normal. My doctor trusted me and gave full support throughout my pregnancy journey. Even at my labor my BP shooted up above 200/100 plus, but confidently made me deliver normally. I'm very impressed with her and also recommend to every known and unknown mothers. Even at the time of festival holiday she guided the duty doctor and came at the right time for my labor (mid night around 12). She is so much experienced that she knows when will I get the pain to deliver. There was no force to go for any c-sec or epidurals irrespective of my high BP.Last but not least, I thank Dr. Mukta for her kindness, supportiveness, and everything throughout my pregnancy.

My wife (Harshini) was apprehensive,excited, nervous, scared, jittery and tensed; she was basically in unknown territory!Appointment taken and we were waiting! Those few minutes felt like forever!! Dr.Mukta welcomed us into the room and she spoke to us just like a friend. She comforted us and asked us the routine questions; she advised us to go for a pregnancy test. The following weekend, my wife and I were supposed to fly to Bali, Indonesia. When we inquired with Dr.Mukta, she firmly advised us against the trip as trips can always be postponed, however, the bundle of joy arriving soon and it's happiness cannot be expressed in words! How right she was!All through our scans, multiple pregnancy check up visits , she guided us along the correct path. There were stages where there were reasons to get tensed and scared, however, she assured us and calmed us. She gave us strict advice to avoid outside food(as much as possible) and eliminate any source that can cause problem to the baby. We adhered to the 'T' and I guess that's what was the best for the baby and mommy!She encouraged mommy to be as active as possible - regular walks, Pre-Natal Yoga (Squats are great) - to target a Normal Delivery. This pushed mommy(and Daddy) for regular walks! Dr Mukta also encouraged mommy (and Daddy) to actively take Lamaze classes (which tremendously helped during Mommy's active labor) . All these are indications to Dr Mukta's sustained efforts for mommy's normal delivery!Come the 'D' day where the bundle of joy wanted to come out and Dr. Mukta was right there to help mommy with the delivery! As Harshini was wheeled into the Labor ward, I wasn't allowed in( COVID restrictions). The next 45 minutes, I can be best described as a Train Wreck. I could hear Harshini pushing and pushing, and there comes our Dr Mukta - She was calm, assured and armed with the million+ deliveries'(feels like it!) experience, she brought out the angel to this world.

She had multiple fibroids and the largest being 25 cms. It was very critical to remove them due to the size of fibroids but doctor Shafalika made sure that she is in safe hands. Right from our first consultation the doctor made her very comfortable and prepared her for the surgery. She is now completely recovered. Thanks to doctor Shafalika for all the support.', 'Visited For Fibroids Removal SurgeryI recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionValue for moneyDr. Shafalika SB is one of the kindest and most empathetic doctors I have ever come across (and coming from a family of doctors, that says a lot!). She is an expert in laparoscopic gynaecological surgeries and her skill and competence ensures successful minimally invasive surgery resulting in greatly reduced recovery timelines.I first start consulting Dr Shafalika at Manipal (then Columbia Asia), Yeshwanthpur in 2019. I had heavy and painful periods + gastro problems triggered by periods. The scan confirmed the presence of multiple fibroids as well as adenomyosis (thick uterine lining).Although Dr Shafalika is a surgeon, she will never advise surgery as the first course of treatment and only when absolutely necessary. Dr. told me I will eventually have to be operated but did not want to operate then. She broke the news to me with extreme kindness and compassion and put me on oral medications to try and suppress symptoms. The oral meds worked for some time but after a few months, I started getting severe migraines. I had moved to the other end of Bangalore by then and did not meet the doctor for my follow up appointment which was due in Feb 2020 due to work related travel. After that, the pandemic started and my visit was delayed greatly (due to my over-indexation on Covid).I went back to meet the doctor after getting severe period cramps and gastritis in Jan, 2022. Again, she answered all my queries with patience and grace and did not rush me towards surgery although we both knew that was inevitable. When I was mentally ready, I went back and got my surgery done by her in June 2022. She ensured I was comfortable and as I didn‚Äôt have insurance, she did her best to reduce the cost of the procedure. It was a complex surgery but Dr. Shafalika was very confident that she would be able to handle it laparoscopically (and she did)!On the day of the procedure, she arrived early and held my hand throughout the administration of general anaesthesia. She also reassured me wrt to the queries and concerns I had. During surgery, it was determined that I also had a bad case of endometriosis. At the hands of a lesser skilled surgeon, there was every possibility that my surgery would shift to an ‚Äúopen‚Äù one. But Dr. Shafalika managed to conduct the same laparoscopically.While at the hospital, I saw how well respected she was among her colleagues at Manipal (and deservedly so). She even came to meet me on a Sunday, the day after my operation!My post-surgical follow up with the doctor has been equally pleasant and efficient. In the follow up meeting, she again spent a fair amount of time with me and addressed all my queries. There is always a long queue of patients outside her office (some from out of town), but she never rushes you. It is easy for a doctor to become clinical as this is routine work for them, but Dr. Shafalika knows that while she has many patients; for the patient, she is the only doctor! \uf04aI developed a UTI infection post surgery and the doctor has been helping me address that very efficiently through telephonic consultation via her assistant, Nimisha. Nimisha is also a very kind and helpful person and enables access to Dr. Shafalika as needed. This is super helpful as I live 2.5 hours away.I have been so impressed with Dr. Shafalika‚Äôs work ethic as well as care and concern for her patients, that I have recommended her to my neighbour who is evaluating similar surgery.I no longer have to plan my life around my menstrual cycle. And am so glad I met Dr. Shafalika and got the procedure done in her able hands and care. Thank you doctor! You are a beacon of compassion and competence ‚Äì a very rare combination indeed.', 'Visited For Laparoscopic MyomectomyHysteroscopyI recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionI underwent a laparoscopic myomectomy and hysteroscopy polypectomy with Dr. Shafalika at Manipal Yeshwantpur on Oct 12th. From the outset, what struck me about Dr. Shafalika was her empathy, humility and commitment. Dr. Shafalika is highly skilled in her field, yet she only recommends surgery as the last option, which is a rare quality for a surgeon. It has been one week since my surgery and my recovery is going well. I would also like to thank the doctor‚Äôs team, especially her assistant Suma, for constantly checking in and reassuring me just before I went in to the OT.

Her reply was like ""I may have many patients Rajeshwari,but for my patients,i am the only doctor""so i do come .She builds trust in patients first,which is very important in any surgery.On the day of surgery,i was full of confidence knowing i am in safe hands.I was put to sleep,my fibroids were removed like magic,and i was able to walk and get discharged by next day.Within next 4-5 days i was able to be on my own.For any one who wants to undergo surgery,don\'t delay,trust ma\'am with your eyes closed.She will never break ur trust.She is an angel afterall :) thank you ma\'am for everything from the bottom of my heart and wish you a good health and long life so that many like me get the treatment from you.', 'Visited For Painful PeriodsHeavy PeriodsAdenomyosis TreatmentEndometriosisDysmenorrhea TreatmentI recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionValue for moneyWait time#longreviewalertI was diagnosed with stage 4 endometriotic cyst in my left ovary along with adenomyosis in the uterus about 3 years ago. Started off with medication that didn‚Äôt help at all. I had severe Dysmenorrhea and would take 5-6 pain killers per menstrual cycle. I tried to get pregnant but that didn‚Äôt happen too. My symptoms grew worse. It started affecting my daily quality of life. For the next 1 year I kept running from doctor to doctor trying to get a solution to my problem and plan a way for me to get pregnant. After running from pillar to post and after 1 failed laparoscopy surgery by another doctor (owing to the fact that my case was very complicated) I had almost reached a dead end, just then through sheer luck I was referred to Dr. Shafalika SB. I was all the way in abroad back then. That first telephonic call with her changed my very life. Given the fact that I had met so many doctors by then, I had never come across a doctor like her ever before. The way she spoke to me over the call, calmed me down like a mother would and empathized and acknowledged the suffering that I was going through was enough to take half of my anxiety away. The confidence that she spoke with, clearly explained me all the details and the steps ahead; She had a clear plan of treatment for me. Whilst I was abroad, whatever doubts I had she would patiently reply to them over whatsapp (despite having such a hectic schedule). She is an incredible person besides being a highly experienced doctor!The surgery was scheduled in April. I had too many apprehensions in my mind due to a failed laparoscopy surgery that I had undergone a few months ago (in abroad). After meeting Dr. Shafalika in person, she clearly took me through the entire condition once again, clearly explained the steps of the procedure and told me the possible outcomes of the procedure. My surgery was extremely complicated one as I had a frozen pelvis (the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bowel, rectum were all plastered to the uterus, the adenomyosis had spread to the entire uterus, the uterus had reached 20 weeks size). It was going to be a challenge and highly risky to separate the organs from one another and then remove the cysts. I was well informed about everything. With a doctor with such a foresight and confidence, I took the leap of faith. Inside the OT, as soon as I saw her, my anxiety disappeared. She held my hand, smiled and said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm there with you. I‚Äôll try my best‚Äù. And with that I drifted into a sweet sleep.They say prayers have immense strength in them. 4 hours later, Dr. Shafalika came out victorious, smiling and in content with the success of the surgery. She was literally god sent! What seemed highly risky and complicated in the beginning was a success now. Dr. Shafalika was able to successfully remove the endometriotic cyst along with the adenomyosis despite the various complications. Having such experience and expertise, you can close your eyes and trust her. Here I am, writing this review because I want every woman out there like me to be able to get help. I shall forever be indebted to her.Dr. Shafalika SB is a gem of a person, highly experienced gynecologist and laparoscopic surgeon specializing in minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery and one of the best doctors that I have ever come across.

She was very empathetic, kind, patient and detail oriented in her approach. She explained all the options in detail and discussed each report. I asked her all the questions that I had in mind, she was answering them in detailed way and was encouraging me to understand more. We then decided to go ahead with the surgery with Dr. Shefalika.Coming to the surgery, the surgery went nicely. Post the surgery doctor updated me on the completion and also showed me the Uterus and the ovaries which were removed and briefly explained the complications that we there in those organs. The best part was the quick recovery. My mom could walk on the same day of surgery and she was discharged the very next day at noon. And everyone at home was surprised to see her walk freely. She in fact was doing the basic house chores on the very best day of the surgery. The doctor had instilled very high confidence in her that she felt she had already recovered fully.Finally, I'm sure many laproscopic surgeons might perform similar surgeries. But the confidence that Dr. Shefalika instilled in my mom (who is very fearful and easily gets tensed) was unbelievable. We stay in Whitefield but got the surgery done in Yeshwanthpur, only because we could get it done by Dr. Shefalika, such was the confidence that my mom had in her.I really recommend her for any gynaec issues, especially for gynaec surgeries.

She also asked us to share reports via emails so that she can advise on mail, thus saving time for both of us.Though I use to travel almost 10KM and wait up to 2 hours to see doctor , I fell which is really worthy waiting.

We did visit the fertility clinic and they advised advanced techniques IVF without actually confirming whether there is really a problem or not. After this point, somebody gave us the contact of Dr. Radha Rao.In the first visit itself Dr. Radha said (I remember very clearly) we will have go through 6 complete cycles before we jump to any conclusion. Also she said we will have to keep track of things with regular medical tests to understand what is happening. She was very much in control of the situation and confident of her skill from the very start. This tracking helped because in the first very cycle the problem was found and rectified. We completed the whole 9 month time period under her guidance and found her way of working very good. She never created fear or urgency to get any extra medical tests done. On the contrary she told us the need of medical tests and the importance to our particular case. There is a test during the second trimester that cost 40,000/- Rupee and is applicable only to couples where the lady's age is above 34-35 years. She did categorically told us that it is applicable to situations where lady is of higher age and is not necessary in our case. Similar she gave the correct opinion on stem cell banking as well.Overall I would recommend Dr. Radha to every body. We stay good 15 km away from Jaya Nagar and the visits to the doctor took full one working day (She does not practice on weekend) because of traffic and tiredness of travel.

She also consults at her clinic by name First Health in 3rd Block Jayanagar. I am writing this review about 10 days post the birth of my son whom Dr. Brunda delivered by means of a caesarian as there was a fetal distress in the 33rd week.We are very impressed with Dr. Brunda‚Äôs proficiency, experience and know-how related to complicated pregnancies and would definitely recommend her as a go-to gynecologist. Her recommendation of a specific blood test in the early stage of pregnancy made sure we got the right medication at the right time due to the presence of a deficiency.The pregnancy itself was a bumpy ride with my wife being diagnosed with appendicitis in the 12th week. Dr.Brunda worked together with another surgeon at Cloud Nine and ensured the appendicitis surgery went fine by recommending specific doses of medicines to ensure fetus can withstand the surgery.Post this, we found that one of the uterine arteries was supplying less blood ‚Äì once again she prescribed medications to ensure we overcome these complications. Despite all complications she always encouraged by wife to keep doing her regular activities and advised us to not treat pregnancy as a handicap but as a normal phase of life. She even encouraged my wife to continue to work during pregnancy.Finally during the 33rd week, one of the scans went awry and when we met Dr. Brunda she immediately asked us to get admitted and performed Non Stress Test (NST) periodically to ensure the safety of the baby. A key thing to highlight is that during the same time, Dr.Brunda was going thru a personal emergency (her husband was hospitalized and in ICU). Despite this, she was a thorough professional and monitored the progress of our baby. Hats off to Dr. Brunda for her dedication to work despite the personal situation she was in. Finally after multiple consultations with another Radiologist who had performed the Pregnancy scans ‚Äì Dr. Brunda decided to proceed with a Caesarian and successfully delivered the baby.However, keep in mind that she is an extremely busy lady and you possibly would be only visiting her once in 3-4 weeks during the course of the pregnancy. You will need to remind her of your specific case each time. We overcame this by making notes and ensuring we go prepared to the consultation session with the questions that we needed to get clarified. Also, note that she is sometimes very open and straight forward if she identifies any issues which may sound a bit negative or discouraging to expectant mothers. But I guess that‚Äôs her style of ensuring she does not set too much expectation.', 'Visited For Pre and Post Delivery CarePregnancyI recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfaction**My previous feedback got wrongly posted under a different user**Mine was a first time pregnancy, coupled with the fact that I was a bit on the wrong side of 30 made me very anxious about the whole thing, initially I was consulting another hospital which was near to my home, but felt that the facilities were lacking, so was searching for an alternative.A friend whose baby was delivered at cloud nine, suggested to consult Dr Brunda Chanappa, and I am so thankful for that.Dr Brunda delivered my baby girl this December, when I first met the doctor, I was scared, as I had read reviews about her being strict and all, but everything changed after the first consultation, as we quickly understood that she is frank, not the one will sugar coat things.I have seen her get angry at a lady, as she withheld the information that her ‚Äúfasting‚Äù blood was not really fasting blood, as she had a cup of milk!!, now the lady most likely is going to feel bad about scolding, and you can guess what kind of review will end up coming from her.This is exactly the point that I want to make here about Dr Brunda.She has more than 3 decades of world class experience, communicates very clearly on what one need to do and not do, some folks may find her a bit of a disciplinarian, which trust me is exactly what you need. She ensured that I don‚Äôt gain weight during pregnancy, never prescribed unnecessary scans or medicines.She has never rushed me, have always answered my questions, as she is a very strong confident person, people tend to be not themselves in front of her, so end up with a feeling that she does not answer your questions, we noted our questions and only left the room when all of them were answered. NEVER once were we felt we were being rushed.She is a no nonsense doctor, laying out the facts before you, does not mince words, or try to sugar coat them, she just wants the best for the mom and the baby, and will definitely throw a fit if you gain weight beyond the limit.For me the pain was induced at night, and the baby was delivered the next morning, all through the night the duty doctors were calling and informing her of my progress, In the morning I was taken to the labour room, the duty doctors prepared everything and then she rushes in, the moment I saw her enter the labour room, I was so so relaxed, cannot explain that feeling, I knew I was safe now.She calmed me down, as the pain was severe, I did not opt for an epidural, neither did she ever recommend that, then very calmly she led me through the delivery process.All through out the pregnancy, there was never an instance where she was rude or impatient with me, she was under going severe stress at a personal level, as her husband was in the ICU, but never once did it show.I have seen her very very stressed out too, a lady was about to lose her twins, as there was a lot of bleeding, she got the lady admitted, directed the doctors on the treatment, then saw me in the consultation room, but her mind was not there, even her handwriting was not the same, we asked her to go and check up on the lady, we will wait, She went and came back a lot calmer afterwards, this showed that her empathy is not at all fake.There was another instance, where she sent a lady who was in the theatre, fully prepared to give delivery, to be told by her to go home, as it was still not the time, she always tries for a normal delivery, unless the situation warrants a c section.I am glad that I consulted Dr Brunda, and will always recommend her to anyone who is looking for a good gynaecologist.', 'Visited For PCOD/PCOS TreatmentI do not recommend the doctorHoped for better: Doctor friendlinessTreatment satisfactionWait timeDoctor had recommended Cervical Cancer vaccine to my wife.

If I ask questions, she talks unnecessary things .', ""Visited For PregnancyI do not recommend the doctorI want to give a review on Cloudnine and Dr. Brunda Channappa.I was completely normal throughout my pregnancy, active and regular excercise. Dr. Brunda never gave sufficient time during my visits and did not explain the delivery process and options such as epidural, etc. She would always be in a hurry.I did not get labor pain even at 40 weeks. She asked me to get admitted for inducing pain. They admitted me to a common room with 3 beds and did not give me a separate room or take me to the labor room due since all the rooms were full. That room had no facilities at all except for one small bed. No space for my husband also.(he had to sit with me on the same bed).A general consulting doctor came in and did my internal examination and said that I was already dialating and pain would start shortly. They put me on drips. After an hour she came in again and did my examination. It was about 11pm in the night. I had my next examination at 12:00am. Post that no one came in to check on me for 5 hours.When my husband went to check with the nurse she repeatedly said the doctor was performing an operation and is busy. By 6pm my pain was unbearable and I could take it no more. I repeatedly called Brunda and my husband was pleading with the nurse to send the doctor to check me.At 6:30am finally Brunda came and also the consultant doctor came in (I was still in the common room with 3 beds and was never taken to the labor room). Brunda then said the baby's heart beat is dropping and they need to do an emergency c-section. My husband and I had to sign a few documents and my c-section was performed.I would never recommend cloudnine or Dr. Brunda to anyone. They only look for extracting money. After delivery i was again shifted to the common room and I had to stay there till evening and then they finally shifted me to a private room.Horrible experience."", 'Visited For Pregnancy Check UpI recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionValue for moneyWait timeI was recommended Dr Brunda by my relative. When I checked reviews about her on Practo I was a little reluctant as many said she‚Äôs strict and straightforward but anyway I went ahead and let me tell that you that‚Äôs the best thing that I did. I was 47 kilos when I was 6 weeks pregnant I was very worried about it but when I met her she said I‚Äôm healthy and she got all the necessary tests done to make sure everything is fine.. the reports said I had very low iron levels and Vit D. So she immediately gave me the necessary tablets and she made sure she cross checked everything just to be on the safer side which I really appreciate... not every doctor would take that extra step. Usually we see pregnancy as a sickness but this doctor made my pregnancy like a cakewalk. She didn‚Äôt warn me about anything she said all you have to do is eat healthy and be normal like how I was before pregnancy..in my third trimester I opted for elective c-section ( it was my decision) she suggested we could go for induced labour but I obliged. She neatly explained the pros and cons of a surgery. Then in my 39th I delivered a baby girl. Doc was on time and she did the surgery with so much ease.. I wasn‚Äôt on general anaesthesia so I had an idea of what was happening around me. She kept talking to me throughout the surgery and I felt so relieved. I trusted her completely. Then came post partum she made sure she changed my supplements and she even suggested on what I should eat and she kept a tab on my iron levels by getting my blood tested. So be it pre or during or post pregnancy she was there throughout my journey with the same enthusiasm. I would definitely recommend her because she‚Äôs such a professional.She also has her own clinic. First health clinic which is close by to Cloudnine Jayanagar. Sometimes when I had to just show her my report I‚Äôd go to her clinic because it wasn‚Äôt as crowded as Cloudnine.I‚Äôd give her a 10 on 10 for her professionalism and the way she deals with situations.

After lot of speculation we thought we should go to cloudnine since we didn't know any other place and we chose Dr. Brunda. Although I have read mixed reviews on practo I thought I should not judge her based on a few bad reviews. So we went ahead since cloud nine assured us that she is a very experienced doctor.So Dr. Brunda turns out to be an extremely blunt doctor with no empathy. On the first visit she made herself very clear that she would not entertain any sob story. Ok, I thought may be that's good...in a way I will be strong. So as my pregnancy proceeded I developed cramps in my stomach...like serious cramps. When I told doctor about those cramps and asked her why it might be happening...her epic reply was, '' pregnant women come with various imaginary complaints, we can't explain everything. If it was so serious today you wouldn't be able to sit in front of me''. However I was not convinced. So I decided to take another opinion. These cramps were really bothering me. So my new doctor examines me, even without me telling her she asked me if i have cramps. When I said yes, she examined me some more and said that my uterus is soft and I have chances of going into premature Labour!!!! She put me on medication immediately. I was shocked. Dr. Brunda didn't even listen to my complaint...didn't examine me...directly concluded that my problem was imaginary. Other than this particular experience there were instances where she would not listen to complaints I had regarding my health. ''Don't cry wolf. Because when the wolf would actually be here I wouldn't know''. So I actually stopped complaining and started googling for anything that bothered me.After this I am definetely never going back to her neither am I recommending anyone to go to her.A piece of advice for the doctor.

I was really anxious & upset to hear that. If she could have hinted the same before then I would have time to find another good doctor but at this late stage I really don't know when my wife could go into her labor pains.Nevertheless, after I returned from the clinic, I took up the daunting task of finding another doctor who could be much at least caring & of course an expert. After a day of search and speaking with my colleagues & friends, I decided to visit Dr. Shobha Venkat at Cloudnine hospital in ORR. Without wasting anytime, I booked an appointment with her the very next day.On the appointment day, both of us were little anxious as we were not sure if doctor would be available & more importantly would accept taking forward my wife pregnancy at such late stage. With this apprehension, we both went into the doctor's chamber.Dr. Shobha Venkat was extremely welcoming. My first impression of her was she is a nice, calm, well poised, well behaved and extremely welcoming doctor. She not only gave us confidence of her availability during the pregnancy but also calmed both us. I found her an expert and the one who knows her work very well. After I came out of the visit, both of us were extremely happy that finally we found the right doctor. There was no other doubts thereafter.As my baby was little more on weight & my wife started showing tendency of sugar inclination, Dr Shobha advised us to go ahead with the delivery a week before my wife's due date. On the planned date, doctor tried their best to help my wife to deliver naturally but things were not moving as expected. Then again Dr. Shobha's expert decision to go ahead with c-sec came handy. I din't give any second thought and decided to go with her decision as I had already built enough of trust on her.My wife delivered on 18th November 2015 with a healthy baby boy. Both my wife & baby were fine and back from OT within 2 hours of post operation observation. Cloudnine provided a unique experience for expected father to be inside the OT and experience this unique new phase.Post delivery, I got a call from Dr. Shobha. She congratulated with her usual warm welcoming voice. It was really nice to hear her as I couldn't meet her post delivery. She also informed me that it was the best decision to go with c-sec as the chord connecting the mother to the baby had started wrapping around my baby's neck and because of that it was quite difficult for the natural delivery and hence the decision to go with c-sec was apt. I was really pleased of myself by trusting Dr. Shobha & going with her decision without any second thought.I really had a very nice & wonderful experience visiting Dr. Shobha. The only thing I regret now is not visiting her right at early stage of my wife's pregnancy.

I never thought I could conceive again, but nature had other plans. I met Dr Shobha at Bhargavi clinic the day I learned that I am pregnant. I was very apprehensive about the chances of this pregnancy completing its term. Dr Shobha's words were very reassuring and she told me to leave everything to nature and pray to God. I did exactly what she advised me. I had gestational diabetes as well. I consulted the endocrynologist suggested by Dr Shobha and followed a very strict diet. I always met the Dr regularly and followed every advise religiously. All my test results throughout my pregnancy were within normal range. I never google searched myself or went for any second opinion regarding the test results in my pregnancy because I always thought that doctors know better than us. As I was busy at work, I could not exercise regularly. Hence I remained active at household chores as much as I could. I took all the calcium and Iron supplements on time and without fail. I had full faith in Dr Shobha and was prepared to undergo either normal delivery or C-section whichever the Dr felt right for me. Her words were always very encouraging. Finally, I had a normal delivery of just 2.5 hours of labour and I delivered a healthy baby girl. My two cents to all those who are planning for a pregnancy or going through a pregnancy - Please have full faith in your doctor, follow their advise religiously, Do not keep changing the doctor frequently, and take everything as it comes. I can't thank Dr Shobha enough for all her valuable guidance and support throughout my pregnancy and delivery."", ""I recommend the doctorHappy with: Explanation of the health issueDoctor friendlinessTreatment satisfactionWait timeValue for moneyBefore getting conceived, my wife was having PCO and we had consulted this doctor. After following her medications within few weeks my wife was pregnant and we were very happy. From that moment we never had changed our hope and made sure that she is the one doing to do delivery for our baby. We had consulted doctor starting from 1st week itself, she is polite in answering questions, even some silly ones without getting irritated. She is very systematic and proper in steps, tells each and every point in a clear manner and writes everything so that we follow them up.We are so lucky and happy that we had consulted with this doctor that too for our first baby. When the delivery time came my wife was too afraid to do normal delivery and she wasn't getting the pain even after 18 hours. She insisted on waiting and doing normally as it is good for both baby and mother. But finally, we ended up doing C-Section and got our cute boy out from the womb. Now he is 8 months old and filling our time and space with happiness around every minute.About the C-Section Procedure, first, it was just 5 - 10 mins, first is the injection for getting local anesthetic in the spine and then operation. I was quite surprised because before even I got dressed to go into the OT the procedure got over. It was comparatively less pain than normal but Post Operation she was having pain for one night. In one day itself was able to walk and the pain was also gone by 70%. By three weeks we were all back to normal.******** * ***** *** *** ** *** **** ************ ** **** *** surely I would recommend 100% for her."", ""Visited For PregnancyI recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionValue for moneyI am writing this on mother's day, as this mother's day is special for me as being mother of a month old boy and all thanks to Dr. Shobha.We started our family planning in late 2017. I conceived in Dec 2017 but after 10 weeks also we couldn't hear baby's heartbeat and I had to go through miscarriage. After that same thing happened in Oct 2018. After second miscarriage in a year I was mentally broken. Becouse of 2 miscarriages Dr. shobha asked us to do some special reports. All reports were normal. Then doctor advice me reduce some weight and be happy and be mentally prepare before trying for 3rd time. I followed same. Waited for 6-7 months and during that time I excercised a lot and focused on healthy diet. After that we tried for 3rd time and everything worked out well and we blessed with baby boy in April.What I like about Dr is she always welcomes patients with smile and say how my girl is doing. This gives positivity and strength to patients. Atleast for the people likeme who are staying away from family and gone through miscarriages in past.She was always reachable through call/what's app/sms for my any queries related health and later when lockdown got imposed due to corona virus.I had normal delivery, that to all thanks to Dr Shobha and her staff from cloud 9 hospital. I had given up and told her staff and her many times that I can't bear pain and please do c-section. But they always told me you can do it we all are with you.Some other doctors might have gone for C-section as soon as patient asks for it. But She was firm on her decision that till things are fine and she will not do C-section and she kept motivating me.She used to tell me make your mind and be strong, you will sail through your entire pregnancy journey and labour time easily. This is very important now a days as we all know that now C-section is not as painfull as it used to be before and we start giving up easily.""]",1,3.0,0.95,1769,30,7,"[1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]",1

After a long search and reading lot of reviews we got some confidence to meet and discuss our next course of action. Since day one we got good confidence on her and with every visit this confidence level increased and we decided to proceed for rest of the process with Dr. Namita Kapoor (with a regret why we didn't choose her since start).We liked the suggestions and the process she follows for whole consulting process to keep it as Natural as possible. And even when other doctors starts scaring with few natural minor complications like in our case for 1 loop round the neck and other doctors were scaring and forcing us to plan early delivery (cesarean post 32 week or 36 week max) because of this which was not necessary.Dr. Namita checked all the previous scans and reports and said because of this there is no need to plan early delivery. we can still wait till last day (with monitoring baby movements at home) and still Normal delivery can be tried. In case baby do not come down and heartbeat fluctuates while trying then on last day last option will be caesarean otherwise most of the cases Normal delivery is possible. We were convinced with the way she told at least she is still trying for normal delivery and there can be chance we can have baby delivered without caesarean.On the Day of delivery. She tried her level best to get baby delivered normally but we can see that every time its tried the baby heartbeat was fluctuating. So considering 2 complications (loop around the neck and baby poop in womb) and heartbeat fluctuation while trying for normal delivery we have to go for emergency caesarean delivery or it will be risk to the baby that we can understand.Our satisfaction was like Doctor tried her level best for normal delivery that was enough for us to still keep on continuing with Dr. Namita for any of our future need. She is great doctor and this kind of attitude and skills are rare nowadays. I highly recommend Dr Namita to anyone who is really concerned about Normal and Natural process and avoid unnecessary intervention. She has great history of Normal delivery even in some complicated cases with great knowledge and skills.Special thanks to Dr. Namita Kapoor for all the support and taking care of what is needed.

Being first time pregnant my mind was full of questions, concerns & useless unnecessary thought. But after consulting the Dr everything was cleared and my pregnancy journey throughout the baby delivery was smooth & planned.During these 9 months I got sick many a time but just one advice from the doctor worked like a charm and I recovered fast. The doctor was always reachable on watsapp/phone during the pregnancy starting 7th months because after this only the critical time of any pregnancy starts as per my experience.Initially after going through certain feedback on Practo saying the Dr. was little ruude to them I was also little sceptical but believe me I was proved wrong with each consultation.Since during the first 6-7 months & carrying the 1st baby our mind is full with thousand of unnecessary question so to take care of those the Dr. had to be like a teacher little strict & always caring to tell you what is right & what is wrong.And sometime we want to be told in a certain way that clears our doubt.And then comes the part when you feel connected with the doctor because of the motherly feeling you get when you are with her.My situation was that I was carrying a big baby inside me. My little princess was 4+ kg when she took birth. Still the Dr. left no stone turned to make sure that I go for a normal delivery rather than c-section. Till the due date I could not have my labor pain & there was no point of inducing me as the baby head was not fitted yet in my cervix. And because of this I had to go for a c-section on my 40th week 4th day of pregnancy.As the doctor also predicted before birth that the Baby is 4+ kg in weigh & it was proved to be correct.Believe me after 15 days of my operation when I think of all the wild thought & scariness I had for c-section all seems silly. It was all because of Dr. Namita Kapoor that my operation was so smooth it feels like a thing of long past already.Post operation day, I am able to manage my house chores, taking care of my baby all by myself.Already its a so faint scar on my bikini line that it doesn't look line I was ever operated (just passed 15 days from operation day). Now also doctor is always available on a phone call & watsapp (unlike other doctors).Doctors Care made me feel that I was in safe hands always. Coming to her is like dealing with trusted family. I can never think of consulting any other Dr..

I thought let\'s go for the best and and went to a reputed hospital for the MRI scan. The hospital staff connected with Dr. Namita as the MRI was not written on the prescription. Then, she said MRI/CT is not required and just go for Ultrasound. I was ok with it and got a ultrasound done. Today when I took all the reports to her.

She told you can wait few more days if you want but get regular nst and ultrasound scans. We followed the same for next 3 days, everything was normal and i got natural pain on 4th day. Got admitted in hospital and i was only 2 cm dialated, we got to know that baby has passed stool in the womb as we waited post edd. There was panic in OT as there were chances that baby might get infected if he consumes the stool. So doctor told me that she would try for normal delivery for next 30 mins but if baby heartbeat fluctuates then we will go for caserian birth. Thankfully i was fully dialated in next 20 mins and baby heartbeat was constant. Dr. Namita closely monitored everything and took right decisions at that time. I had very smooth natural delivery within 1 hour of getting admitted in hospital.

Dr. Namita discussed all possibilities with us and we decided to go for C-sec as baby is fully grown and we do not want to risk mother health.On the final day Dr. Namita spent an hour with us explaining about the C-sec and pre and post procedure and risk.

We got her reference from Practo itself and based on the review experience and ratings, we decided to go to her initially. Being apprehensive as all to-be parents are, we were not sure of anything in the beginning. But after a couple of visits we were confidant of one thing, if not anything else, that she would be the doctor we wanted to continue for the entire time. Dr. Namita is straight-forward and precise to a point where it might be considered rude by some, but in our experience we realized that, this specific attribute is what we required to be in our doctor. She would not spend time in unnecessary details and explanation not pertinent to the well-being of the baby and the parent. Our session with her were short, precise, to the point and detailed with respect to relevance. She never prescribed any test or medicines which would not be imperative to the baby\'s or mothers health and constructive progress throughout the course of 9 months. She specifically mentioned what and where to do the test and not to go for any unnecessary expenses. My wife gave birth to our beautiful daughter at exactly 40 + 1 week. Dr.Namita‚Äôs support was the maximum at the end. We had opted for a normal delivery, she also supported the same. For my wife however, the pain did not come on its own, even on the due date, Dr.Namita was fully patient and wanted to wait for normal, and went for an induced pain. After 3 inducements, my wife started responding, it was almost 24 hours the contraction pain started, it was taking her a long time to go into labor, but Dr Namita was willing to wait even more and explained everything to us in pristine detail. It was completely our decision to go for a C-section, even though she told us there‚Äôs a good possibility of a normal delivery, only it would require little more time. Once our decision was done and confirmed she took my wife to the OT. Within 15-20 min the operation was done and my wife and our daughter came out all well and healthy. Even on the 2 days my wife was admitted for recovery, Dr.Namita came on regular visits checked her thoroughly and prescribed very little medicine.

As we desired for a normal delivery she suggested what all will be helpful . And truly each and every of her advise helped .During the last trimester she gave us a clear way ahead preparing us for a course of delivery and the best caring part of her was that she told us that I am available 24X7 now ( on phone text or in person) .

MTP is a medico-legal procedure. Has to be done at registered place by the registered doctor. 2.

I had given you a very clear picture of the MTP package, with inclusions and exclusions. It's pre decided by the clinic. Doctors don't interfere and don't don't have any say in it. 4. Every absence from the clinic doesn't mean vacation. It can be emergencies( personal or professional). And like you said you had travel plan, doctors also have their plans and holidays. And as I said to you- I wouldnt prefer to change my clinical guidelines and procedure methods based on patients personal issues. If your yravel plan was more important than the MTP, you are free to decide accordingly. 5. I share my number for Real emergencies and sharing reports. I prefer in person discussion for other queries. 6. I gave you the contraceptive advise. You were always free to ask more if it wasn't clear or you wanted other advise. 7. Depression - happened a month later after your MTP. Treating depression isn't my clinical qualification... And replying to such messages also isn't medicolegally advised for us. There can be various reasons for depression. Would suggest you to meet a clinician for the same. 8. Feel free to go to a pharmacy and take the treatment .

Instead of wasting your time and my time writing such a lengthy feedback it would have been much better if you had put more thought into your consultation in the first place and neatly written down your requirements when we had asked you to do so.If you were better organised the confusion and rework wouldnt have been necessary. Writing multiple messages back to back during evening OPD hours will not help as I have only two hands to work with and the only condition on which I accept these online consultations on Practo is that I should be able to respond to them at a time that I am free ,after I have attended to my clinic patients. If you do not have the patience to wait for a follow up response and expect an immediate response,let me inform you that it is not possible.We have been allotted 24 hrs to respond by Practo. You are quick to call us unfriendly(because of delay in follow up) but I just find your whole attitude towards me rather rude and ungrateful especially when I was running high temperature and still working beyond my capacity to attend to your umpteen changes in requests. Most of you are not even aware of what you are entitled to in a Practo online consultation and unnecessarily keep ordering us to call you back which is also out of line. Fed up with the unreasonable demands that people have on these online consultations I have reduced it drastically to spare me the headaches of these online consultations.

Our first visit was around at 7 weeks and followed by at 12 weeks. During 7 weeks of scan Dr. has confirmed the twin pregnancy and 12 weeks reports were completely normal with Monochorionic Diamniotic Twin Pregnancy (Twin share same placenta). Everything was going healthy and as recommended by Dr. , we went for next checkup/scan at around 20 weeks. During the initial scanning by Junior Dr. they got some doubt and after detailed scanning by senior specialists, they have confirmed that twins has developed ""Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome""-Stage III; a rare pregnancy condition where one twin gives away more blood/nutrients than it receives in return and another one receives too much . If untreated both the babies will die eventually due to organ failure -possibly within one or two weeks. However, as per the suggestion of Dr. Asha and team we went to BFMC and did the Fetal Laser Ablation surgery within 1 week. Yes, obviously everything went well and the surgery was successful and again we visited Dr. Asha at around 27 weeks. Again after there were few complications like severe itching (Liver Cholestasis) in body, low hemoglobin level, Gestational diabetes etc. which Dr. Asha managed very efficiently. There are many instances in which she had guided us through WhatsApp message/call without any hesitation, even after normal working hours. Finally after our last ultrasound scanning Dr. had advised us to get admitted after 7 days and did some routine blood test. Report came one the same day night in which platelet count for my wife was around 80000 against the normal value of 2.5 lacs. Dr. Asha intervened immediately at 10 pm and directed the Motherhood Lab to do the test again. Obviously same report came within 1 hour which I received by WhatsApp itself. Dr. was doubting it could lead to HELLP syndrome and advised us to get admitted on the same night. Next day afternoon Dr. Asha did the cesarean delivery with two healthy babies. Yes, as I am writing this post after 4 months, both the babies are healthy and growing well.
