Doctor suggested to remove it by burning the dead skin and operating . There was a receptionist but no nurse.

The receptionist gave antibiotics and cream that were different from what the doctor suggested without checking with me. Doctor said I can remove the bandaid after one day. The wound started to ooze with fluid and I called the doctor's office and the receptionist said its very common and nothing to panic. I removed the bandaid but the looked scary. I went to another doctor 2 days after surgery and the doctor said that the following things went wrong: tetanus should have been given, all surgical wounds should be covered till healing, should have probiotics when taking strong antibiotics, surgery for callus should be the last option. I hope the readers benefit from my experience."", ""Visited For Acne / Pimples TreatmentI do not recommend the doctorHoped for better: Value for moneyDoctor friendlinessTreatment satisfactionThe issue is if I explain why I wasn't satisfied, the doctor will write a long explanation of why I am wrong. I've never seen a doctor write such long explanations to prove a patient wrong!But I feel if my feedback helps somebody else, it's worth reading the long reply the doctor is sure to right.I went to the doctor because of my recurrent acne and boil problem. He didn't examine the affected area but said that this issue is common. I figured that the doctor is an expert so he did not need to see what the problem is. Then he spent 2 mins writing the medicine and 2 mins telling me to minimize sweets and milk and then 10 mins telling me about chemical peels which is kind of expensive I know of other clinics which offer salicylic peels at Rs 500 per session and his price was triple the cost. . (I understand that he is a celebrated doctor so treatment may be expensive!) My previous dermatologist told me to go for peels only after the pimple subsided but this doctor said there is no such condition.Then I was asked to buy medicine from the clinic itself by the receptionist which I felt was fishy. No dermatologist has specifically asked that. I refused and went to 10 pharmacies who all said they don't have the medication. Finally a pharmacist told me that that particular doctor prescribes medicine that are expensive and rare so no pharmacy would carry it!All in all, I was not given much explanation of what's wrong, the medication is impossible to find and I was advised something that some other doctor advised against. So i have no clarity and will have to see another doctor, spend another few hours and another few thousand..I understand if the doctor didn't find my issue serious enough or had a long line of patients to see, so he could't devote time. But I will not understand if the doctor writes a long essay explaining why I am wrong and he is right. It's highly unprofessional and unheard of! I request you to let it go, you treated me and I gave feedback. Let that be the end.I'm sure you're a very good doctor so I mean no offense to you.Dr. Parthasarathi Dutta Roy repliedDear Tanya, The issue is that when you give a feed back and tell why you are not satisfied, it is completely your opinion.Then when I give my answer to that, it is my opinion, my point of view. There is no intension to prove anybody wrong. My explanations are backed with logic; I do not write whatever comes to mind. Whether you are right or me would not be judged by either you or me but by the third parties, the viewers. I am happy that you have never seen a Doctor to write such long explanations. That shows that the Doctor is different in some ways and he cares for his patients. I do not want to be one among the lot. Because of the softness and decency of the Doctors today situation has come to a point where Doctors are getting abused and beaten up in different parts of the country. Doctors are getting abused everywhere inspite of trying their best to save your life. So a message should go to the society that all Doctors are not pushovers. If you attack Doctors it should be given back with interest, and for doing that if you do not like it have no problems. If you are giving a healthy feedback with logic it would be appreciated, but if you write something without logic and just to express your grudge it would be and should be answered. After all you can not write anything and everything comes to your mind in a public platform and expect the other person not to reply. I am really thankful to Practo for providing a space where Doctors can put their point of view and tell their side of the story. When you feel that giving a feedback would help other people to understand the Doctor I also think that my long explanation and feedback would help people to understand the situation. First of all, for your kind information, hundreds of patients of mine got results with my acne treatments and you yourself must have seen that in the net and that’s why have consulted me. I equally distribute my timings between examining a patient, writing prescription and explaining procedures, so telling that I have given more time to convince you for a chemical peel is totally unfair. For the treatment of acnes I usually follow three steps, first take history and write prescription, second tell you about your diet and third I explain you if any procedure is required(in your case it was Salicylic acid peel). Why did not you mention in your feedback that Doctor has also told you that the chemical peels are not absolutely compulsory but optional, in addition to the medications to enhance the results.You have spoken about Sali peel and also mentioned that it would cost Rs 500/- in other clinics. I am very curious to know where those clinics are, whether you are talking about a Clinic in Bangalore or in any other town or village? Show me a centre in Indiranagar,Bangalore where chemical peelings are done for Rs 500/- I promise you I would give you 6 sessions of Sali peel free of cost. Secondly when you say that another Doctor asked you to do peels after acnes subside, you are not only showing your ignorance about the subject but also putting the Doctor down as well. Salicylic acid peels are done to reduce pimples, what is the use in doing it after the acnes subside? Besides, this is our clinic price which is same for everyone. If you can afford it take it, otherwise leave it, why you want to make a big fuss out of it? Did we force you to take that? I must mention here that you have got a very sensitive nose since you can sniff everything fishy very fast. If the receptionist has asked you to buy the medicines then he is just doing his job. Just imagine at the most what it could be due to? He has just thought from the business point of view, anyway you have to buy the medicines from some pharmacy,so if you buy it from our pharmacy we will get benefited, that’s it. Whats wrong in that? Anyway I have given them a strict instruction, henceforth not to ask anyoneto buy medicines, since some people tend to take it in a wrong way, whether medicines are available outside or not. You have written that you had no clarity and you have to consult another Doctor which would cost you few more thousands,my question is have you taken the medicines I have prescribed and seen the results? If not then why blame the Doctor?You have nobody but yourself to blame just for not trusting the Doctor and following his instructions and that is why thinking another Doctor. I can tell you confidently if you would have followed my instructions you would have definitely got results and would not have to visit another Doctor and spend few more hours and few more thousands.And do you think it needs few thousands to consult a Doctor? It is really unfortunate when you doubt the intension of a reputed Doctor. I had prescribed you a course of antibiotic, a combination cream for your acnes, a non comedogenic moisturizer and an anti-acne face wash. That is what I prescribe my other patients as well with your kind of acnes [Grade-3]. Tell me what extra medicines I have given you and are these medicines very expensive? To prove yourself right you should not be a liar. I never tell my patients to buy medicines from my centre unless asked. If only they ask me where to get these medicines I may tell them that these are available in the clinic pharmacy itself.Is it wrong to keep some result oriented medicines which has given results to so many of my patients and what can the Doctor do if these are not available in other pharmacies? On the contrary patients are happy that they are getting to buy the medicines in the same place unless people like you who finds everything fishy in every small thing.When you say that one pharmacist told you that this Doctors medicines are costly and rare and we do not keep, do you think that the Pharmacist is seating there to do social work for the society? To answer your sarcastic comment I would again say that yes I am an expert in my field and for that I have spent 10 long years of my life in training. Besides I don’t see anything great in that. When you work in a particular field for a very long time automatically you become expert in that. Softwear people becomes expert in their field,teachers become expert in their field,actors become expert in their field and so on. When you accuse the Doctor that he did not explain things properly I must mention here that In the beginning itself I tell all my acne patients that pimples are due to hormonal fluctuations and there is no complete cure for pimples, only we can keep it under control with medication, what more explanations you expect! To conclude, I must inform you that this long assay is not for your understandings. I am least bothered about that. If someone decides not to understand things come what may, nobody can help him. This explanation is rather for the public,the viewers and for my regular patients,if they are satisfied with my explanations I am happy. I do not need to learn professionalism from you nor do I need your certificate. I have got enough certificate in my credit from all over the world. All I can say is Doctors devotes time according to the merit of the cases, do not be so impatient and suspicious in nature and do not judge a Doctor only on the basis of a 15 minutes consultation and without seeing the results of his treatment."", 'Visited For Skin Disease TreatmentI recommend the doctorHappy with: Treatment satisfactionDoctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueA Dr. With Extreme wisdom!

Comment for Doctor:- Please take the time to clearly explain what has happened(if they are wise enough to comprehend) to other patients. Still, I am happy with the treatment and discussion.Clearly:- I recommend him for the precise treatment, do not worry about the advertisement at the front desk, it is a bit over-exaggerated.

I was suffering from acute hair loss Hair DiseaseHair Mesotherapy PRP for hair loss. And was suffering for the past 2 years, consulted doctors and wasted my money on them but now i am so happie with the result after visiting and consulting dr. Juvitha. Extremely satisfied & happy Short background: -I started doing research for finding out the best clinic in Bangalore for Dermatologist and trichologist in August 2021. In a course of over 2 years, after spending around 15k just in consultations with around 10 top clinics, I zeroed down on two of them & finally selected Dr. Juvitha. If you think about a good clinic in Bangalore, chances are that I have probably visited that. :) My reasons to go for procedure with Dr. Juvitha : - (i) 17 years of experience - Dermatologist, Cosmetologist and trichologist started gaining traction in last decade in India, so technically she is in this domain since the beginning with renowned Dermatologist and Cosmetologist in Indiranagar, Bangalore. She is the Medical Director of Dr. Juvita's Aesthetics, Skin, Hair and Cosmetology Clinic, in Indiranagar, Bangalore. Her clinic is the best rated dermatology center in Bangalore. She is a lady Dermatologist in Bangalore and has an experience of 17 years. Dr. Juvita as been chosen as one of the ' TOP 10 Cosmetologist in india YEAR 2021', by Women Entrepreneur India (ii) She is a Cosmetologist apart from being a Dermatologist Dermatologist, Cosmetologist and trichologist. Trichologist is a lot about aesthetics. No matter how good a treatment is done if the final appearance is not good it amounts to nothing. So, a touch of artistry by someone trained in it would most of the time be better than the one not trained. (iii) Very accommodative - I asked over 100 questions during consultations (Many of which I knew the answers about from my visits to other clinics but just to be sure one final time, lol!!). She answered all of them. Changed my timings for consultation & few other tantrums, all accommodated. (iv) Results- I saw results of patients who had undergone treatments and services & interacted with them about their experience. Now what sealed the deal for me: -(iv) Integrity - While at many clinics I was suggested to go for higher number of grafts which she could have done as well & made some quick and easy bucks. But she suggested me to preserve my grafts & go for what is required (A great suggestion in retrospect!).When I insisted to go for more graft for more density , she also assured me that she would do a second followup again without extra charge if I was not satisfied!!! (top notch professional medical ethics, hard to find these days!!) Treatment Experience(i) Administrative officer there - very helpful & friendly, took care of all the things after and been with an good follow up for next sessions (ii), Doctors were very punctual, and did not wait a long time for consultation. I was not. 🙂 Final word :- I have taken time out to write this review only because I am very happy with my results & this is least I could do for doctors who are skillful & have not yet yielded to the commodification of healthcare in a world where it appears that entire ecosystem is designed to rip you off !!

All of the credit goes to Dr.Shashidhar.I had been facing hair loss issue since 4 -5 years. Initially I thought that it’s a normal but unfortunately there was no stop on my hair loss. Gradually, the baldness increases and there was a big bald area that everyone could notice.Finally, I thought of going for hair transplant. I was aware of the procedure but my knowledge about the procedure was very limited. I researched a lot to learn more about the hair transplant and soon I found out about Dr.Shashidhar T from Dermacare Skin & Hair Clinic. I would say he is genuinely transparent and would never rush you to take the decision. Hair transplant is not a small decision as we have to spend a good amount of money.Finally, I believed the benefits of hair transplant and chose to go for it Dr.Shashidhar is very popular and an excellent surgeon for hair transplant in Bangalore.When I consulted him, he informed me about the grade of my baldness and required hair roots for hair transplant. He also explained me about the details and procedure of hair transplant and cleared all the queries I had regarding the procedure. I was impressed by the transparency they maintain as they did not sugar coat the things and gave genuine suggestions.Finally, I picked up a date and underwent hair transplant. The procedure went as expected. The whole team of Dr.Shashidhar is very experienced and it reflects in their work. I am not well versed with the instruments they used but the technology they use was latest. They maintain utmost hygienic practises while performing hair transplant.After hair transplant, the healing was easy going, because they will provide all the necessary information about DOs and DON’Ts post-surgery. Now it has been 1 year of my hair transplant and I can see an amazing hair growth. The hair growth looks absolutely natural. Except for the people already know about my hair loss, no one could identify that I have gone under hair transplant.

After that he gave medicines and I took a week rest. It was very smooth but I can feel pain for few days.Doctor was very very.

Suddenly one day i woke up with a big acne on my forehead and eventually in next 10-15 days my face was full of acnes and comedones. My forehead had all big painful acnes and my cheeks and chin was covered with tiny comedones all around. I was completely devastated. No idea what to do and where to go.Then one of my friends recommended me about TrichoDerma.Immediately I booked an appointment and met the doctor. He told me to have my patience and that it might take upto 3 months for full recovery.He treated me very well with lot of care and patience. Every 10-12 days i used to visit him and he used to consult on the medications. He also gave me 2 comedonal treatment where he removed almost 40-50 comedones in 2 sittings. I was also given pills for 2 months . By Aug-2017 all my acnes and comedones were gone. My skin was smooth and soft. But I had all the scars that were left over by the pimples. It took me another 30-45 days to get me over the scars too.Today my face looks clean and I am hopeful that in next 20-30 days I will get my old skin which I was missing since 6 months will be back.Dr.Shivashankar B.

Shivashankar to anybody after what he has done to my skin.I was taking treatment from him for over 4 months for skin pigmentation. When none of his medicines worked over the months, he suggested that I should go for a Laser surgery. Since I am out-stationed, I took one sitting of the Laser which was done by a person who was a professional in doing the same (and not the doctor). The skin pigmentation all over the face was burnt by laser, however after a week, the wound healed and the result was good. I went for a second setting, as the Doc said 3 setting minimum was required. This time the professional was not called and the Laser was done by the ""Receptionist"" of the clinic. Yes, the doctor was confident enough to hand over the instrument to the receptionist to burn my face. She burnt my skin deeper and spreaded it all over my face (even where there was no pigmentation) making the situation worse. It took 2.5 weeks for the wound to heal, but the marks remained deep and dark unlike the 1st setting. Meanwhile I had to go back to my native and the mark remained growing deeper and spreading all across my face.The pigmentation has become much worst and now incurable. Dark Brown patches are all over my face now and I can\'t even go out to public gatherings.If you want to recover from your issues, kindly never visit him.

Unfortunately I wasn’t able to reach the concerned doctor again even after multiple attempts and the allergy progressed to facial swelling. It was rapidly getting worse and that’s when a family friend recommended Dr.Govind to me. In retrospect, I think consulting Doctor was one of the best dermatological decisions I could ever have made. The medicines prescribed by Dr.Govind worked wonders for me.2) In the past, I have been prescribed multiple medicines for long periods of time. Unfortunately, my issues were never quite resolved with these medicines.Dr.Govind prescribed only one medicine and so far, it’s seemed to address all my dermatological issues.3) In the aftermath of a respiratory infection, I developed rashes which seemed to be present for a while. At the beginning of the consultation, even before my explanation regarding the infection commenced, Dr.Govind took one look at the rashes and immediately asked me if I had been having any respiratory issues lately. It was quite surprising to receive an immediate and accurate diagnosis by Doctor even before the explanation began just by a quick visual observation.

Dr Govind and Team Therapeia', 'Visited For Hair TransplantI recommend the doctorMy hair transplant experienceBefore I begin this testimonial let me tell you that I was really apprehensive about going for a transplant and with the kind of stuff I was hearing from people I seriously thought even if I were to get one I would get it done abroad. I would just like summarise my experience point-wise to make it more objective.1. I was never forced to get a transplant down which was a big difference compared to many prior meetings with various doctors and clinics.2. The Transplant procedure was clearly explained to me as an option alongwith the pros and cons of getting one under 2 methods FUE and FUT I chose the former after checking as to what suited me best.3. Dr.Mittal is one of the most approachable doctors I have known and I have sometimes asked him the same questions multiple times and he has always been there to answer whether it is 10 in the morning or 10 in the night.4. The surgery in itself was a long procedure but I never felt uneasy and never felt like it was a surgery I undergoing . I was impressed with the meticulous preparation and planning that he does and although the surgery was performed at a new hospital there were no hiccups and there was no panic in the air at any point in time. I would also like to mention that the team Dr.Mittal has is fabulous and are very patient. At no point at time was i suffering from undue pain or discomfort.5. If the transplant is the cake post-op is the icing and this is where I strongly believe is what sets Dr.Mittal apart. Further The PRP sessions were great and done meticulously with utmost care and precision. I must appreciate the effort he puts in ensuring that you are actually following the post op routine. The results have been encouraging so far andOn the whole I can say if you are thinking transplant you can blindly go to Dr.Mittal.', 'Visited For Skin TreatmentI recommend the doctorHappy with: Explanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionValue for moneyDoctor friendlinessWait timeI am very happy & extremely satisfied with the treatment given by Dr. Govind Suresh Mittal, whom. I have been visiting for the past 3 months. In the past few years, I had visited several Dermatologists for treatment and they had diagnosed my skin problem as ""Eczema"" on my hands and legs. The treatment prescribed by them used to worsen my skin with lot of rashes and itching, which eventually led me to stop the treatment. The problem was so bad that many people asked as to what has happened to my skin. My family insisted on me looking out for a better dermatologist who can diagonize properly to give better treatment and I chanced upon Dr. Govind Mittal.
