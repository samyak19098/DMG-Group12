Ramesh is a living god on earth who helped me to recover from problems related to heart.I surely recommend this doctor for patients suffering from heart problems.He is very down to earth and makes patients feel very much comfortable during his consultation.Not like other diagnostic places, here this Doctor sits along with the Radiologist in order to diagnose the problems. This is a great advantage in his clinic.He gives huge hopes which are more necessary for recovery instead of actual medicines.Let me explain my story.. I had suffered from palpitations and breathlessness and i was wrongly diagnosed with ""Rheumatic heart disease"" by a big hospital in Bangalore. Because of this shock i could\'nt sleep for 15 days and also the palpitations used to occur frequently. Thanks to Practo.com from where i could get the contact of Dr.B.Ramesh.I have been under the care of this doctor from past 3 months and i have almost recovered from my health problems. This doctor has huge experience and he has got the knack of diagnosing patients just with Stethoscope. He initially diagnosed me just with his stethoscope and said to me ""You don\'t have Rheumatic heart disease :) "". These words bought me great relief, self confidence and made me very happy. Then later i was taken to ECO scan room and the doctor explained me clearly what the exact issue is and what is causing all the palpitations and breathlessness symptoms.I have huge confidence on this doctor and i feel myself that nothing bad is going to happen to me since Dr.B.Ramesh is always there for me to take care of my health.I am now back to my normal activities and i am able to concentrate more on my work.Doctor has given me the confidence that i can eat anything, i can go for trekking, and as usual continue with my normal day to day activities.Many times i have visited his clinic and many times he has advised his receptionist not to collect fees from me.My hats off to his dedication and service to mankind. Long live this doctor so that many suffering patients can be cured.', ""Visited For ConsultationI recommend the doctor*** ****** ** ** ********* ****** *** a wonderful human being. We visited him to get a second opinion for my father's cardiac health. He had undergone ECG, ECHO and TMT tests wherein the previous doctor had suspected a blockage in heart and recommended to perform angiogram test followed by angioplasty. We were extremely tensed as my father is a very active person and we did not expect something like this to show up suddenly hence we thought of having a second opinion by one of the leading cardiologists in Bangalore i.e. Dr. Ramesh and no doubt whatsoever when people term him as a Living God. He is extremely down to earth and very humble in nature. He listens to you very patiently and examines you carefully. He checked my father using his stethoscope and went through his reports stating Sir, you are absolutely fine and you do not require my services.. these words were so reassuring for all of us and we were left teary eyed but these tears were of joy and happiness as doctor mentioned that no further tests or surgery is required and that my father can carry on with his regular routine. I am very glad that I was able to find out Dr.Ramesh through Practo and hence my special thanks to the Practo team."", 'I recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionWonderful Doctor! Dr. Ramesh received me well and heard my problem patiently. I was getting chest pain in the left side, which has been persistent from 6 months now. He reviewed my previous test reports and then started his diagnosis.Based on physical examination, ECG, TMT test and also considering my previous test reports he mentioned to me that I have no heart related issues and I must not unnecessarily worry about the pain I am getting. The root cause of my chest pain was not established in this consultation, but he being a cardiologist, assured me that the pain I am getting is not related to heart, which I was more concerned about. He made me comfortable, provided me with much needed confidence that I have no heart related issues. He advised me to think positively, eat healthy and do regular exercise.Overall, it was a very nice experience at his clinic. I would like to express my sincere thanks to Dr. Ramesh, THANK YOU Sir.I will recommend Dr.Ramesh for anyone who needs cardiology consultation.', 'Visited For Hypertrophic CardiomyopathyI recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionValue for money****** * ****** ** *** ** *** **** ************ ** *** ******** His attitude and humbleness is above all. He is very down to earth. My father was suffering from breathlessness and was under treatment under various other doctors but with no improvement.He was suffering from Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Doctor Ramesh very well explained us the problem by drawing the diagram of heart on a paper and helped us understand the various treatment options available. He also encouraged us to enlighten ourselves by reading the pros and cons of one of the surgery option available to us (Alcohol Septal Ablation). There was an other surgery option as well but that was a major open heart surgery. So we stick to Alcohol Septal Ablation as the doctor suggested my father will benefit from it. He carefully performed surgery on my father which significantly reduced the muscle thickness (LVOT Gradient) and the symptoms. Now my father is feeling very well.I would suggest everyone reading my review that Doctor B Ramesh is a really very good doctor with huge experience and you must visit him for your cardiac issues. He is professor and various doctors work under him to learn.

Rudely, she told ""OK go and wait out side"" doctor will come later as he is occupied, I asked ""how long I have to wait ma\'am"", ""need time "" her answer. I asked can u be specific as, if my dad case is not a cardio problem then I need to see general physicia too. Then she said ""OK wait for 15-20 min I\'ll call you.Doctor came, he asked what is the issue patient facing ? Told all of them whatever I said to Lady assist, then they did whatever they need to, then while Leaving Dr. Ramesh said "" don\'t be restless we have lot of other patients to check"", so told him clearly ""what so ever been communicated to you was wrongly misinterpreted, I never asked I want to meet doctor immediately, I clearly said I can wait if I know how long I have to"".Now tell me someone when I was restless and when did I said I want to meet Doc asap.As he is very senior doc, I don\'t want to create any nuisance, didn\'t say anything further and left.** ******* ******** *** *** ****** **** **** ***** ***** *** ** **** * ****', ""Visited For Heart ConditionsI recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionFirst of all, Doctor allowed me to tell my version and he explained why my situation was not a problematic one his explanation convinces me and he gave me his expert opinion on the prescription of the other doctor's recommendation which helped me a lot get rid of my doubts.

The TMT came negative and we were saved from an unnecessary procedure.Incidentally, my TMT was also positive and he immediately dismissed the report. He did not even charge for my consultation.

My mother was suffering from Takaysu Arteritis. We have been to 'medanta the medicity' hospital and Jayadeva hospital before. Doe to this disease she has multiple blockages in various parts of the body. To open blockages we even tried Chelation Therapy in Goa but all went in vane.My mother had to undergo three surgeries in Medanta and total of 6 stunts wee placed in her body. But still after few months symptoms of blockages reoccured. Dr. Rajpal referred to us Mr.Ramesh Jois who also sits in the fortis hospital. Now the treatment goes parallel with both the doctors. We know that this disease is incurable but Dr.Rajpal has been very helpful throughout. From past year and half we are visiting Dr.Rajpal every two months.In March 2014 we had angioplasty in medanta for my mother but as nobody suggested any Rheumatologist to us even though the disease being diagnosed the blockages recurred. In August 2014 Doctor suggested for the angiography and my mother was having 99% blockage in one of the artery. Dr.Rajpal handled the case very properly and did her stunting and explained us the consequences. He also explained us that there is still blockages but that being risky should only be cured with medicines. From Aug 2014 till now everything is going fine. My mother still have little bit of symptoms but this disease is like that only. When the disease was diagnosed we had three operations in the span of 4 months. But now its been more than year and half we did not required any further operation. We have advised to go for few tests to check whether the disease has not been spreading fast again and is stopped to certain extent.From that time we are very particular in visiting the doctor regularly on time and always been taking the best available prescribed medicines for the better results. Doctor is very polite and listens to my mother patiently each time we visit Dr.Rajpal. We are satisfied with the treatment and how this case was being handled when all the other big hospitals and doctors gave up.

The doctor is great and excellent. He has given intensive care and attention for the success of treatment. And now, we are on follow up consultation with him for a certain duration. Generally, one and a half hours will be the waiting period, which is really high. Last time, it was higher than usual but that day doctor was in emergency surgery and that is understandable.
