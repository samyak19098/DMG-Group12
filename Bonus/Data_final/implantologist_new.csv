That is the most surprising fact. Regarding RCT, mine was not done properly hence infection started after few months. They said it is human level error from their side. Cleanliness and hygiene condition is very poor. You have to remove shoes even when the support staff keep on roaming with dirty shoes. The passage or ladder to go up stairs is very dangerous.

I am a cosmetic dentist and a surgeon. I start and finish root canal with cap placement. In between one session is always done by root Canal specialist (not any junior doctor). If root canal fails, it is due to chronic infection,means if patient comes to us with late infection stage ,root canal cannot be guaranteed. At our clinic we do 100-150 root canals monthly out of which 5-10 can fail because poor prognosis of tooth. And it is same in all clinics of the world.

I had done my research and had figured out that a surgical extraction would be the only way going forward and owing to all the YT videos I had seen, was very apprehensive about this procedure.I did visit a couple of other docs in HSR itself to get a better understanding of what the condition was and what the other alternatives could be out there to explore apart from the eminent extraction - neither of them gave any proper explanation nor discussed about the alternatives properly and wanted to starightway jump into the procedure , one of them also wanted to get the upper wisdom tooth extracted (normal) along with the one next to the lower wisdom tooth(impacted) and were also trying to sell me how a PRP (Platele Rich Plasma) would help in reducing the swelling post the procedure and that would come at a certain cost. I was very much dejected to say the least and had lost all hope.It was at this stage, I met Dr. Chandan and he was Good sent to say the least !!! He came across as a person who was very much passionate about what he does but his knowledge about his field was massively impressive. He not only explained to me very clearly and in simple terms about the status of my current situation but also explained what the possible alternatives at this stage were along with their pros and cons - further more he was also very much patient and bearing towards the plethora of questions I had and not once did he ridicule my concern. He strongly suggested against getting the upper wisdom tooth extracted as it was seeming to be in a good state.He walked me through the extraction procedure in great detail and was very much up front about the pain aspect of it. He explained what all he would do to mitigate it prior to starting the procedure and he also informed me about what to expect post the procedure as well. Given his carring attitude and the depth of his explanation, I agreed to getting it done right away.Post the procedure, I followed his instructions to the dot and I literally had no swelling what so ever!

We were planning to travel next day but cancelled the plan and started looking for dentist. I showed it to different dentist but they suggested immediate RCT or tooth removal and the cost estimated was also very high. As she was diabetic, I was bit skeptical about this and had no confidence in doctor around. Even with high dosage of pain killer the pain was not subsiding. My mother was saying lets do something for pain, I will goto village and get it done there. Finally I took her to Dr Suresh with reference from Dr Nagaraj. He asked all the details, checked the teeth and said today I will just do the clean up for the infection and put medicine. She will not be in pain after that. You can travel without any worry. After you are back if she is comfortable we will do RCT else she can get it done from her village doctor.This suggestion itself gave us lot of confidence and we gave go ahead to this. He showed lot of patience, did the procedure as per her comfort and talked very calmly throughout this. My mother was very happy with him.

I haven't been using my right side if the jaw for years even after a 'successful' treatment was carried out here in Mumbai. It was only after Dr. Suresh's treatment that I came to know what was wrong and after he 're-fixing' my tooth, iam happily chewing away from the right side of my jaw.
