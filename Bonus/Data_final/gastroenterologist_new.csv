I know surgical patients do require quite more attention but that doesn’t mean OPD patients are free for the entire day, they also have their regular commitments and deadlines, especially if someone is planning to take a day off to meet Mr. Gowda in Koshys hospital then it might not give you an appropriate results.At my first visit on 28th Sep 2022 (around 10:25 AM) I have been informed that doctor is in OT and you need to wait or visit either in evening or tomorrow. At the next day on 29th Sep 2022 (around at 9:45 AM) where I was almost first in the queue to meet the doctor, again the same story Dr went for OT first and returned back by 11:35 or 40 AM. Overall if you are a surgical patient then it may be good choice for you but being a OPD patients hospital and management won’t respect you time, they might consider you are free for entire day and will treat accordingly.I do have respect for OT patients but the hospital staff (who is already aware) that any surgery will take approx 2-3 hours so at least they could update the same to the patients however the billing desk is very well trained only for fixing the appointment* *** **** ********** ** ********* **************The hospital management at-least update the proper visiting time for OPD patients because being an OPD patients if you want to meet Mr. Gowda in Koshys hospital, then timing are actually not from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM, it’s just any random 30 minutes in between and almost upto 3 hours out of 3:30 hours is only for surgeries.At the end, visiting to Mr. Gowda in Koshys hospital is not worth for the patients who do respect their time, rest it’s upto you…. Thanks!My overall comments are based on waiting time because finally I decided to visit some other hospital since in my 2 days trial I never get chance to meet the doctor and at last I asked billing desk for the refund.Very bad services in Koshys hospital !!!Dr. Maruthesh Gowda repliedThank you You have left review without consulting the doctor great! You are taking frustration of front desk on doctor! There are two kinds of schedules - elective surgery - I never schedule it during OPD times Emergency surgery - need to be done ASAP.
