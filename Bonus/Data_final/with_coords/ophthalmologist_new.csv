Here’s a brief history of my condition when I visited her –I had been a user of soft, disposable contact lenses for more than 10 years when one unpleasant morning, I woke up to red, swollen eyes, hazy vision, and a change in the colour of my eyes. I was in considerable pain that particular day and would rate the pain as 2 on a scale of 10. Following that day, I consulted two Ophthalmologists in the city – Dr. Regi Thomas and Sanghamitra Burman, the former being associated with St. Johns while the latter was attached with Vasan Eye Care. My condition continued to roll downhill and my vision got hazier and eyes weirder. One would put me on strong steroids while another would ask me to exercise my eye muscles and want me to stop bothering with my eyes – to her, the pain I was going was of little significance. Whatever I did, my discomfort started to engulf me. Thankfully, a friend recommended a great ophthalmologist at Manipal Hospital who like I mentioned earlier happened to be the Head of the Department of Ophthalmology too at that time – Dr. Ajanta Chakravarty.Extremely patient with her subjects and eager to understand their symptoms, Ajanta Chakravarty immediately had me as her admirer! Besides patiently listening to me, she smiled and assured me that she’s going to bring me a smile very soon!Before putting me on crazy dosages of medicines considering the serious condition of my eye, she instead probed my symptoms and tried to understand the root of the problem which in my opinion every doctor should. She changed my diet and added fruits and vegetables that are rich in Vitamin C, supplemented my diet with Vitamin C, and put me on a general antibiotic eye drop combined with a lubricating eye drop. Though my body was dealing with the infection in a better way with the help of the heavy supplements of Vitamin C in my diet, I wasn’t feeling well.My eye started to deteriorate and a grey circle started to appear around my eyeball suddenly one fine night. I was at Manipal at 9 in the morning the next day waiting to be see the first. I was collapsing from the pain and my eye was so swollen that I had difficulty wearing my glasses. She was appalled on seeing my condition and immediately ordered a scrape test on my eye where they would scrape tissues from my eye and send them to the lab to get to the root of the problem. The painful procedure was finally done and reports were inconclusive. On the one hand, I had a doctor who was feeling helpless because she was unable to treat me, and on the other hand, it was my pain and discomfort that were slowly draining life off me. That’s when she recommended me to Dr. Mushtali Vagh on Infantry Road who she deemed better suited to treat my condition.Even though Dr. Chakravarty transferred me to another doctor, I hold her in high opinion because she did her best to treat me and transferred me only when she thought she couldn’t help me anymore, just in time to save my vision. I understand my eye infection was a complex one and that it was not easy to treat – so my Ophthalmologist did her best and exactly what she thought would relieve my pain. Doctors aren’t god, they are humans after all – so respect them as real individuals who do their jobs well.To say the least, you would be in trusted hands if you consult Dr. Ajanta Chakravarty as your Ophthalmologist.', ""Visited For Cataract SurgeryI recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionValue for moneyI would recommend Dr Ajanta for Cataract surgery.

Assistant did a checkup after 30 minutes of wait, and then had to wait another 30 minutes to meet the doctor. So net 1 hour delay to meet the doctor.- Not too confident on the power checked by the assistant, normal checkups at Titan Eye Plus and Lenskart had both showed no change in power (exact match) whereas here both the eyes something had changed. Now it might be that both of those guys were wrong, but I would rather get a check again to be certain.- Doctor did not check the power for himself. Not sure if that is the norm these days, but at least till a year back the doctor always rechecked the power.- Doctor appeared pretty casual about everything, like nothing seems to matter. Probably tired too. He wanted me to come again for a proper checkup since the eye drops would take 30 minutes to show effect. After waiting from 7:30 to 8:30 doing nothing, I am told that it will take another 30 minutes for the eye drop to take effect. Do I have to state the obvious that this could have been done much earlier? And I was willing to wait but doctor was little less interested so I decided to give it a pass.- Overall, will have to go for a second checkup.

The doctor had already advised you to meet a physician as you were showing signs of URTI like fever, sore throat and viral conjunctivitis which are related. Since it is highly infectious , personal hygiene was advised for others safety and as such there is no specific treatment but rather a symptomatic treatment.
