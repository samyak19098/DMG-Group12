It has been increased or mostly relieved from time to time. There were only small patches on scalp and around ankles‚Ä¶etcRecently in June 2016, psoriasis has attacked on my face violently for first time. It was much aggressive than before very itchy and unpleasent. And it happened after a big stress in my life. Fortunately I met Ayurveda Physician Dr. Chaya at Serenity Wellness Institute, JP Nagar, Bangalore. I went for a consultation and I understood that all the steroid based treatments that i was doing before are just suppresing my symptoms and more they will suppress more it will accumulate in the body and more strongly it will come back, and she explained me that this problem can be very effectivly treated in Ayurveda with detox therapy, which is called ‚Äúpanchakarma‚Äù. In panchakarma treatment there is no suppression but it is taking the toxins out of the body to which my immunity was reacting.Once the toxins are out, our immunity does not react and no symptoms are produced on the skin, So i begun immediately ‚Äúpanchakarma‚Äù (detox) treatment at ‚ÄúSerenity Wellness Institude‚Äù in Bangalore.There are five different procedures in Panchakarma but for me only Vamana (one of its kind in panchakarma treatment) was recommened.My doctor choose to do Vamana for me a Panchakarma procedure, I felt as different person right after the treatment. Which was for total of 9 days plus 7 days of diet restrictions as an after care, Almost all the patches and wounds dissapeared. It made my mind very calm as well through the body. After that I started taking care of myself with the diet, lifestyle and some medicines as prescribed by the doctor and I am feeling much better than before. I find my self fortunate to find this amazing treatment for my disease, If I would not have done this, I would have fallen in the trap of steroid creams and other harmful chemical medicines, which would have ruined my health.On contrary Ayurvedic treatment not only cured the disease, but also made my overall health and energy levels much better.From my experience and from other patients experience those who were taking treatment for psoriasis during the same time in this clinic, I would humbly recommend Panchakarma for all the patients those who are suffering from psoriasis, as I have understood that Suppression is not the treatment for this, Panchakarma detox is a much better approach. And we can save our health from all these harmfull steroidal, chemical treatments, which harm us more than the disease itself.ALL THE BEST SERENITY.Best regards,JAY KUMAR', ""Visited For Psychological ProblemsI recommend the doctorHappy with: Wait timeI had 2 sessions with Dr Chaya. First one was one to one with Dr Chaya and second one was with Dr Chaya and Dr Sampritha. I was dealing with a lot stress and loneliness from past few years. The good part is I was able to open up with Dr Chaya which otherwise was a biggest hurdle for me to share my emotions. I needed urgent counselling because I had to make some life changing decisions related to pregnancy. Second session was arranged within 3 days given the urgency. I wasn't given any follow up advice after 2 sessions which did not give me any closure.I only have one complaint. She was constantly checking her phone from under the table. I tried to give the benefit of the doubt that maybe she is checking something important. But it was for way too long. It gave me a feeling that she wasn't interested in listening. But the fact is I was there for mental illness which I could not sort out on my own and needed a professional to hear me out and help. It pushes the person further away who is anyway having problems with talking about emotions."", 'Visited For Death and bereavement issuesI recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionValue for moneyHi, I‚Äôm Divya Anand born and brought up in Bangalore, What I‚Äôm about to say is not for the sake of review alone but it is a message to the thousands of people who have a suicidal ideation every day. On an average, there are 123 suicides per day. An astounding figure that reflects the issue of mental health and its ill effects if not taken care.Yes, I was also suicidal. I felt like I was floating in a sea of emotions that were drowning me and pulling me into the abyss from which the only escape was to commit suicide. I quit my job, I was disturbed due to a failed relationship.Suicide seemed to be the only answer to all the guilt,embarrassment, disappointments, failures and negative experiences that have broken my heart to pieces, these pieces refused to be broken and feel broken for another day and suicide seemed like the answer that could give me freedom from the prison that I had built within my mind and I dreamed about this freedom every day.Negative experiences for a High Functioning Depressed person such as myself is more influential in our mind then positive experiences in our life.Some part of me still wanted to live after a failed attempt.I urge all those who have a suicidal ideation to first hold onto this part of their mind. Somewhere deep within us there is a small part that will still want to live, still want to love again, still want to experience life to its fullest irrespective of the circumstances.After which I urge you to take a positive simple step of reaching out for help by just googling a qualified counsellor in your locality.In my case I got onto practo.com and I choose Dr. Chaya Jambigi at Serenity Wellness Institute, situated at JP Nagar, Bangalore on 7th April 2018.It has been a lifesaving and life changing decision.Just talking to her and expressing all my negative experiences, gave a relief.Then I also met another counsellor Snehal who has been my therapist and is helping me in handling the negative emotions in my mind. Today slowly but steadily I‚Äôm able to dispel the sea of emotions and soar up into the sky with ease.I thank Dr. Chaya Jambigi and Snehal for their continued support and understanding towards my condition. They have played a major role in helping me survive an illness.Today, I‚Äôm not entertaining any suicidal thoughts in my mind.I have gone out to meet new people. I‚Äôm looking forward to starting my social entrepreneurial firm. I‚Äôm also looking forward to a Yoga instructor course in the coming month.An illness that is silently killing thousands every day. It can be due to impulse or due to planned decision.I recommend their services to all who need help.The first step in solving any problem is to accept that it exists in the first place.We have all been too silent about suicide.We feel bad to talk about it. We feel that we are weak to admit that we have thought about a cowardly act.We have judged ourselves for so long. Our pride is more important to us.If all can be humble for one moment to accept the flaws that we as human beings have then accepting the fact that all of us at some point of time in our life have had suicidal ideations and that some have acted towards such an ideation and some are going to do so is a given fact.Let us spread awareness about this flaw and prevent it.Let us encourage the help that psychologists, psychiatrists and counsellors provide and urge the people who need it to reach out to these individuals who provide a helping hand during desperate times.Suicide is never the answer. There is more to life, by saying NO to Suicide.We say YES to our parents who have invested millions in us in the form of love and money.We say YES to people who will love and accepts us as we are in future.We say YES to positive experiences in life.We say YES to the simple pleasures in our life.We say YES to our dreams.We say YES to another day.We say YES to the small steps we can take every day, like making a planned routine, by exercising, listening to music, watching movies, yoga, meditation all these to becomea healthy functioning individual.We say YES to handling situations and experiences in a healthier perspective. If your heart is broken by a lost love, remember there are many people who are still searching for love and you can still go on dates and find another person a better person.If we take things lightly, we see that there are so many opportunities still open to us all we need to do is be alive to take it.People are climbing mountains and running marathons when there are aged 90 years, anything is possible.So, I urge you to say YES to LIFE because you are priceless and life is still bearable with more positive experiences waiting for you, Music and Books always by your side along with professional Help just a click away.Seek that light and the light within you will slowly shine.God, bless you all for reading this, please share this with all you know. Somewhere, someone really needs this message.Take care.RegardsDivyanand', 'Visited For Shoulder PainI recommend the doctor""The best ayurvedic place!‚ÄùThis was my first visit to Serenity Wellness but for sure not my last.

Regards Keva Ayurveda Customer Support', 'Visited For Body WeaknessI recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessThe clinic location and doctor were good.Though, I had complained about body weakness and cough, the doctor advised me for 12 days ""PanchKarma (Shodhana) chikitsa"". Which I later (9th day) learned to be taking simple medicines at home, followed by 4 massages and a loose motion on last day.This could be good by itself, but didn\'t help my weakness issue & cough.Before going there, I saw several good reviews, but didn\'t see anything about the pricing of the ""PanchKarma"", so I will like to point it out for patient\'s and clinic\'s help.## Consultation charge is 250/-## PanchKarma constitutes-- 24 Hajmola like digestive pills for 4 days (2-2-2 per day); no clinic visit-- 150 ml bitter Ayurvedic ghee for 4 days (15ml-30ml-45ml-60ml); no clinic visit-- 1 hour body massage; which is followed by 15 mins add-on (Shirodhara, Or herbal wash, Or head massage) for 4 days; need to spend 90 mins at clinic (includes hot water bath)==>They charged me 10k/- for all the above.On the last day I inquired on individual massage, to which the reception lady told 1000/-, which includes free consultation and 15% discount on medicine !!24 hajmola and 150 ml ghee won\'t cost more than 200/- and the massages + add-ons will be 1250 x 4 = 5000/-.I ended up paying double for the same treatment which were available individually. Usually it should be other way around. If you take something in bulk, then that should be discounted. I felt naive for myself not to inquire all these in beginning.Dr. Krishna Kumar repliedHI Milind, Thanks for your valuable feedback. U were suffering from High cholesterol levels and low immunity since 3 years and u had tried almost all treatments for the same when we advised for medications, u didnt want any medicines / supplements but u wanted to do Detox Programme. ## There were no availability of slots but u insisted us to accommodate and we somehow managed to give you appointments. Our doctor planned only 12 days of treatment for ur multiple issues. We cant split the cost as you have done. For your reference  last 4 days of treatment Abhyanga + Shirodhara + UDwartahan + Steam for 1.5 duration per treatment ( BAsed on the complaints these will change ) per session is Rs.2000, along with complete support frm doctors for all days ( priceless)  We never force any customer to undergo the therapy at our place as the slots are full. You can also check at other places and definitley novody wud charge less than 12,000   RegardsKeva Ayurveda Customer Support', 'Visited For AcneI recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionValue for moneyI had been suffering from severe acne on my face since October 2014. I had sought allopathic treatment for the same in the past. It did help, but only temporarily and finally lead to tolerance of the antibiotics prescribed and more acne. I was very distressed due to the continuous acne breakouts. I had tried almost everything starting from home remedies to homeopathy, but nothing really helped. In June this year i finally decided to seek ayurvedic treatment for this and met Dr. Krishna Kumar. He put me on some blood purifiers and suggested simple life style changes and dietary modifications. After about a month of starting my treatment he also suggested me to undergo charmaraksha chikitsa which is basically panchakarma treatment for skin. The combibation of blood purifiers and panchakarma reduced my acne breakout to quite an extent but some eruptions continued, however, those were not painful and puss-filled like before. After panchakarma he then put me on an ayurvedic medicine to regulate my hormonal levels and that did the biggest magic and my acne breakout came down very very significantly. After 6 months of consistent treatment my skin texture has become quite smooth and blackheads on face have also reduced. I hardly have any acne on my face now. I just have some scars left which are also disappearing gradually.I am very grateful to Dr. Kumar for helping me overcome a problem that i had been fighting with for 3 long years in just 6 months. I had actually lost hope, but he helped me regain it. The best thing about Dr. Kumar is the way he listens so patiently. He just focusses on one thing at a time. The step by step and structured approach he follows is appreciable. God bless him.Regards,PriyaDr. Krishna Kumar repliedDear Ms. Priya Puri, Thanks for your valuable feedback. Your feedback matters a lot. It‚Äôs coz of your dedication in taking medicines or following our doctors instructions. Such feedbacks will help others in choosing Ayurveda.

The only outcome from doctor visits was spending alot of money on treatments, medicines with zero outcomes and my pain kept worsening each day. A dear friend of mine suggested me Varaprada Ayurvedic Centre for the first time I happened to meet a doctor who actually made me sit and listen to all my problems in detail, made me run few tests. On the test results he briefed me about the problems I was unaware of which included hyper acidity that made me lose my appetite, sacroilitic joint pain resulting in my lower back pain, vit B12 deficiency that caused weekness, cervical spondylitis causing my neck and upper back pain.

He has been a time and life saver for me atleast in this new city where I just arrived.Let me start from the beginning what problems I had and what events took me to Dr. Vinay sir.I'm from Himachal and I got job opportunity to join on IT Company here in Bengaluru.Back in home while doing WFH for long time , my back got stiffed, severe pain in my back and right leg , I developed Sciatica, also my posture was also bend on the right side . I took some Physio sessions there at my native place for 1.5 months and once I was straight enough and relieved from pain I decided to come to Bengaluru. While coming back in Airport I sat on one of those massage chair to have one session there , right after that I realized that the comfort I had earlier with my body is no more there and by the time I was having same problem again as I had earlier.I observed it for couple of days and it was getting worse as earlier. Then I start looking for the treatment for the same. While searching this time I decided to go for a Panchkarma treatment as I was already aware that along with external treatment or physio sessions , I need to improve my overall body strength too. I thought of giving it a try here otherwise fly back to my hometown with no other choice left.I found Dr. Vinay S. Singarajapura number on Google. I gave him a call on Thursday around 4.00 PM saying that I'll be coming to your Centre by evening today afte my office hours . And that day I didn't able to make it . But when on weekend I took a taxi and reached there on his Centre location and then gave a call without any appointment scheduled, he picked up the call and asked if I have an appointment, I told him that I just came now via taxi (from 23 kms far away) , and without saying more he told me to wait for some time, while he come back to attend me.Once he is in clinic he starts his observation and the after observing my pulse (naadi) he told me so many things which I was already aware about my current health condition and he advised me a well defined treatment plan.He prescribed me some Ayurvedic medicine, and started Panchkarma and manipulation therapy on Wednesday onwards. After completing those session , now my spine problems are not bothering me much and I'm still continuing the follow up sessions to recover it to the original state.Later I come to know that when I came here for his clinic on weekend that time he was about to leave Bengaluru for couple of days , but since I told him that I came in a taxi , so he might have thought that this guy is coming from long distance and so he still took some time for me from is busy schedule.After Dr Vinay's continued support and advice now I've relief and some peace of mind that I can restore back to my original physical and mental health.One more thing about his Panchkarma Treatment Centre is a well maintained, hygienic place , where someone can feel they are going to get well soon.Thank you Dr. Vinay S.
