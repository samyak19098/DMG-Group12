Recommended for sure for age related issues', ""I recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionValue for moneyWait timeTwo months into our marriage, my spouse, who is 29 years old, complained of a headache and haziness in front of his eyes. As I was new to Bangalore, I looked up online for a good neurologist and found Dr. Krishnan's address. He suggested an MRI to eliminate all extreme possibilities. Because my spouse is claustrophobic, we requested him for an alternative, but he insisted on it. And I can't be thankful enough to him for this. Through the MRI, we found out that what we had been dismissing as a migraine, at the most, turned out to be a blood clot in the watershed region of the brain. In short, my spouse had suffered a minor brain stroke. The moment I got to know this, I called up Dr. Krishnan. We fixed an appointment with him, and he patiently explained everything to us. Further, he made sure that we went for the relevant tests to find out the cause behind it, even though he was able to guess that it was B12 deficiency. In the meanwhile, he put my spouse on medicines to gradually dissolve the clot and prevent any recurrence. The test results were able to eliminate many possible causes and indicated that the stroke was probably induced by a B12 deficiency only. He immediately prescribed him B12 injections and asked us to make some lifestyle changes.A brain stroke is not something that one hears of often, so you can imagine how panicked and scared we were when we found out about it. But we are so lucky that we have had Dr. Krishnan's guidance and expertise with us every step of the way. He has been so patient, friendly and prompt throughout. I can't thank him enough for this.It has been almost a year since the stroke, and by God's grace, my spouse is doing fine. As is usual after a stroke, he is still on a blood thinner and some preventive medicines, but these don't affect his normal life functioning in any way.I super-recommend Dr. Krishnan, and hope that my story gives hope to anyone who is reading it. :)Dr. P.R. Krishnan repliedI have no words to express my thanks for taking time to write such a detailed feedback.

Told us MRI but when we went to the scan center they told spine MRI angiogram for heart. Im not sure why was that required. At least doctor should tell us why he is prescribing the tests and what is the link for the headaches.

By chance I met Dr Krishnan in Nano hospital and started taking treatment from him sometime from the year 2018 and since then I am under his treatment for all my ailments . Considering my age (77 years), I would say that most of my problems have been treated to my fullest comfort level and medications were also minimum. Wherever it is necessary, without hesitation he refers the patients to specialists of specific diseases.

So we brought her to Bangalore and consulted Dr Krishnan at Fortis hospital. Her condition improved within couple of weeks and she was able to carry out her daily activities as usual.Unlike few doctors I encountered who burden the patient with several costly tests right at the beginning, Dr Krishnan took a step by step approach for diagnosing the problem. He started with simple doses of medication, kept reviewing the progress on regular basis , ordered additional tests as and when needed and kept changing medication when needed. He is patient enough to answer any queries we may have.I recommend Dr Krishnan for any balance related problems, parkinsonism."", 'I do not recommend the doctorHoped for better: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionValue for moneyWait timeDoctor - PR Krishnan - My mother was suffering from hypertension and since two days she got dizziness while sleeping, nausea, vomiting sensation, left arm was paining.

He is very friendly and patient. Told him all my symptoms. He checked my BP and it showed 132/116 which is high. He prescribed me a tablet to lower my BP. Asked me to get my brain scan done and another test and come back to him. Meanwhile he would analyze if this medication is working. I left and contacted another doctor since my BP was abnormally high. Upon checking, my BP was 120/80 which is a normal range. He was surprised as to how a person can prescribe low BP tablets without checking twice when I don't have a high BP history. Within an hour I went to another place and got my BP checked which also showed normal. If not for a second opinion, I'd have ended up taking meds to lower my BP despite having a normal range.""]"

However, this time, our experience with the doctor was really bad. The only word which comes to my mind is unprofessional, while we were trying to narrate our problems, he was busy scrolling his phone and kept on receiving calls. He also dialled a number and then said, I got a call from this number so let me check. The call was a sales call, and to our surprise he continued speaking to the sales person over call enquiring about some scheme.All this while, we kept our calm and continue when he disconnected the call. Despite the file being in front of him, it seemed as if he had no idea about what was going on and then he narrated some diagnosis which was complete opposite of what he said in first visit.

I was admitted to the Sri Sathya Sai Super Speciality Hospital Whitefield, Banglore in the year 2012 after my first paralytic attack which of course was a very late diagnosis unfortunately due to the absence of any other visible symptoms till then. The MRI reports revealed that lesions in my brain & spinal cord were eight year old (chronic lesions) and the directionality of the disease at that stage was such that I would be fully paralysed below chest and confine to a wheelchair at any point of time in future according to the western medical science. But then came a divine intervention in my life in the form of Dr. Joshy E V who not only treated me with love and care but also helped me in living a normal life by reversing back from the clutches of MS attack because of his judicious combination of allopathy and holistic treatment. Being a Biology teacher by profession I\'m now leading a perfectly normal and healthy life. I\'m also a proud father of two children, that too after my paralytic attack. In fact I have written and published a book on 23rd February 2020 entitled \' ""MS"" to"" My Sai""... A journey with Sai\', with the soul intention of giving courage and solace to all chronic Neuro patients by taking them to the level of quantum healing which is 100%possible if you get a blessed doctor like Dr. Joshy E V. I strongly endorse Dr Joshy Sir for patients suffering from any kind of chronic Neuro disorders because Dr Joshy Sir\'s unique way of treatment includes first making the patient\'s mentally stronger followed by the administration of medicine in the most appropriate way and in most appropriate doses ensuring that the patients will not fall a victim of ADR(adverse drug reaction).

I had started developing pain and swelling on my right neck region which further spread to my shoulder, back, head, ear, arm, hand, palm and fingers; all on the right side. After running from general physician, ENT, dentist and orthopaedic; and multiple medicines, I decided to consult with Dr. Advait for the unbelievably positive reviews on Practo. Hence, I went to him and got a sense of relief when he said that it\'s nothing serious, removed my previous medication, prescribed me physiotherapy at his clinic for 10 days and just one vitamin tablet. Being far from my place and not having a private vehicle, I chose to take physiotherapy at a clinic 2mins away from my home. According to Dr. Advait I was fit to start working post 4-5days of my consultation with him, but surprisingly my physiotherapist recommended 7 days of complete bed rest as my condition was really severe and had become chronic. Once done with physio, I resumed work and in an hour of working, my pain had come back. This time so severe that I couldn\'t bear, I had no choice but to continue with shortened hours for one more day until my right hand felt completely weak and as if I had lost all sensation. I couldn\'t even have food. My physiotherapist recommended getting a scan and asked me to check with Dr. Advait once. I went for the follow up the same day, that\'s today and I was asked to pay 1k as consultation although it was just a follow-up. I denied.Now, the moment I sat I started speaking of my issues and was worried. Dr. Advait ******* ******* **** ******** *** told me to go upstairs and get an MRI done and come back, his words right after ""I usually charge 1k after 5 days of consultation but if you avail our services (MRI scan) I won\'t charge you. You do the scan and come back."" I was shocked but obeyed and went to the reception where I was asked to pay 7.5k upfront and my prescription taken.I had 7k in my pocket after all the running around from doctor to doctor, multiple medicine courses and needed some time to arrange the 500 bucks and cab fare to return home. I started calling up people, in the meantime I was asked twice by the receptionist to hurry up as (their words) Dr. Advait had called twice if I had done my scan or to pay the consultation. Multiple phone calls later, things felt not very reliable and decided to go to a ****** hospital to get my scan done. I was taken aback when the receptionist wasn\'t returning back my prescription for not paying consultation fee(please note, there was no consultation. there was no new prescription involved, nothing recommended to cure my condition; just an instruction to go get the MRI done from his clinic ***** * *** ***** ** **** ****** ******** **** Was I going to run away with his 1k* ***** ** ****** **** ******* * **** ********* ***** ********* ** ** ********* ******* ****** ***** *** But I paid, silently I paid him 1k *** ******* *** went back home crying with 6k in my pocket without any idea of how I\'m going to start all over again with all the running from doctor to doctor, medicine to medicine.*** **** *** ***** ****** ** * ***** *********** ****** **** **** * ******* ***** ** ******* *** ******** ***** ******* *** ****** * ** ********* ***** *** **** *** ********* ** **** ********* ** ******* **** *** It pains to think that like the past one month, I will have to spend another sleepless night crying in pain.****** **** ***** ** ******** **** *** ** ****** **** ***** ** **** *** ******** *** * ******* *** ***** ** **** ** **** ******* **** ****** ****** ******* ******* *** ********* It costs nothing to be kind *** *** ***** ** ******* * ********** ******* * ****** *** ******* ** ****** ********** *** *** * ******* ** *** **** ****** *** **** ************', 'Visited For Neurological ProblemsI recommend the doctorHappy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionValue for moneyWait timeExcellent doctor with friendly nature explained briefly about the problem very good experience treatment was very satisfied overall superbDr. Advait Kulkarni repliedThank you Ramya for your Feedback!']"
