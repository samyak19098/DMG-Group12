I find Dr A K Gupta to be a very humble kind human being that complements his expertise in ""Integrative Medicine - Holistic Treatment for the patient"".

I during my search online for treatment options for my mother ( in particular edema and respiratory issues ) i came across Dr A K Gupta - Ovihams. I contacted Ovihams for emergency treatment options - i was soon put in touch with Dr A K Gupta . Dr A K Gupta sir spoke to me on phone and heard the medical issues faced by my mother and then he advised if i can visit his pritampura clinic that is nearest to my home in North Delhi. After informing Dr A K Gupta that my mother is on Oxygen support 24 by 7 and is in an extremely critical medical condition, i enquired and requested if Dr AK Gupta on humanitarian grounds could come to visit my mother at Hospital where in she is admitted. Dr AK Gupta unlike other Allopathic doctors , understanding the seriousness of the medical complications and sensing extreme pain, hopelessness in my voice as son , ageed to personallly visit the hospital. Dr AK Gupta as a medical expert knowing the emergency medical condition did not delayed and the very next day made visit to the hospital, met my mother, understood and heard her medical issues, examined her, counselled her and above all gave her a ray of hope and confidence to my mother and to myself and with confidence stated that ""edema and respiratory issues will get treated and she will be fine"" and above all he counselled me and my mother, listened to my mother and did not in any way showed off that he is running short of time or is in a hurry . Dr A K Gupta came across as a family person ( rather more than that and for me Dr A K Gupta is a god sent angelic divine healer having respect for patient feelings/ mental and physical trauma and patient suffering/ patient irritation - i saw sincerity dedication and commitment to patient welfare. Dr A K Gupta immediately arranged for the medicines ( homeopathy ) the very next day so that the treatment can be started. Dr A K Gupta subsequently followed up on the prognosis and after getting a status update on her medical condition advised further treatment that is being presently continued. As i have to attend my mother 24by 7 and having no one else in the family , finding myself in a state of hopelessness from modern medicines/ allopathic doctors - i have tremendous respect and regards for Dr A K Gupta , i sincerely hope my mother gets fully cured of her edema and is free from 24by7 respiratory problems . Dr A K Gupta has pioneered and practices Integrative medicine as a patient can get benefit from each/ any and or in combination of various pathy\'s under medical treatment.
