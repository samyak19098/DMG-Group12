In most instances the extra amount is usually conveyed at the reception to the patient, you have not been informed about it prior to the procedure, that is a mistake on our part, If you still feel you have been unjustly charged, please come to the clinic and I shall arrange a refund.

Though the treatment involved nasal drops, it was given with the intention to relieve the nasal block and hence the ear. On your follow up visit since you did not find much relief with medications, the rest of you options for relief were discussed. This was in no intention to force any form of treatment onto anybody. You can chose the doctor and treatment of your choice. If you have felt that way because in a busy opd we are trying to explain a lot of information in a short time, I would like to apologise for it.

You are one of those people whose motto is just to speak ill against we doctors,just to gratify your inner satisfaction. Now coming to your case. You visited our clinic with impacted nasal stud,and the treatment of choice is removal under local anaesthesia. Before proceeding with the case any surgeon on this earth would give test dose using 2 percent lignocaine(0.5cc in left forearm),since this drug is highly reactive and can cause severe anaphylactic reaction.Only after confirming the drug is not reactive,we proceed to the local area for 2nd injection so as to numb the region. Therefore two pricks is inevitable for any surgery under local anaesthesia on this earth. And these thing were well explained to you in clear words in your language, devoting 10 minutes for this. You gave your consent for the procedure,and requested our nursing staff to shift you to the procedure room. The moment you heard that two pricks has to be given,you started creating scene there in front of other patients and started screaming that the current environment was hostile and started crying inspite of explaining the entire procedure before hand which was never expected from you. In your words you expect us to do any procedure as per your wish,as per your will, without giving test dose endangering the life of innocent patients,and if we do something as per the law,as per the ethics you would express your views in this way.In simple words you should have just told NO I don't want to get it done and get away but it seems you had visited our clinic just to malign our name. We doctors feel pitty on people like you,who thinks medical profession should work according to your dictat. At least you all should think of the people who are daily sacrificing their life for people like you in this pandemic and still you are having grudges against the medical fraternity that too when we are right. Last but not the least ,we doctors are serving and sacrificing our life not for reviews but for the sake of humanity and just for your kind information we have not closed our centre for a single day during last 15 months inspite of ravaging pandemic,just for patients who are in real need,who really need genuine treatment and medical attention except people like you who has made medical profession a joke."", 'Visited For LaryngoscopyThroat infectionsI recommend the doctorI visited Dr. Nithya Shree with Throat infection, I had tonsillitis and also had pain down the throat, She has been extremely good at diagnosing and identified both are separate issues and provided the right solution, Very professional doctor and courteous staff.', ""Visited For Ear Wax (Cerumen) RemovalI recommend the doctorShe is detail oriented.

Went to few doctors who advised steroid tablets which I was not fine with taking, however i took it for 3-4 days and then stopped it fearing side-effects. These doctors didnt guarantee that i will get back the hearing, another reason for me not to take the med. After around 15 days, I came across a video from Dr.Rohit talking about this issue where he mentioned that if you start treatment within 48 hours of losing your hearing, it can be completely reverted. Though 15 days had passed, I still thought of trying my luck and went and met the doctor. The doctor was so friendly and he explained the treatment so well that I was ok to take the steroid injections. Since it was a localized treatment, I was convinced by the doctor that the side effects will be hardly any. He answered each and every question of mine very patiently and made me so comfortable that i effortlessly went through the treament. He gave me so much of hope with the way he handled me. I went with 65% hearing loss and after 5 days of treatment, I got 68% hearing back. I could start hearing better. Doctor asked me to wait for another 1 month (without any medication) and check again. The audio metry results further went up by 75% which was a great improvement. I am convinced that this doctor can do miracles with just the way he takes care of his patients and would strongly recommend him for any ENT issue especially sudden hearing loss. The main point is that you shouldn't ignore this and go as soon as possible, ie within 48 hrs and he guarantees complete cure."", ""I recommend the doctorHi AllI sharing my experience because of give information to suffering and struggling middle class people,One of the best hospital, cleaning treatment is very good but as per my experience service of Doctors, nurse staff is super good , they treat us as a family membersMain person is Dr Rohith Uday Prasad, in my life like this Doctor I never seen, his caretaking , service, advoice no other give , he is best doctor,After treatment, surgery, service when discharge time I feel he is like God , it's 100 % trueFor my 2 year baby I done cochlear implant surgery here , in Bangalore I don't know anyone and I don't have more knowledge, when we meet Dr Rohith, he advoice some test, give correct treatment, medicine etc. To be frank every 2 days once he called taken status of my baby , finally today surgery done.
